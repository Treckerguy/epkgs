 :commentary "\
This file implements reading, editing, and saving files with
text-properties such as faces, levels of indentation, and true line
breaks distinguished from newlines just used to fit text into the window.

The file format used is the MIME text/enriched format, which is a
standard format defined in internet RFC 1563.  All standard annotations
are supported except for <smaller> and <bigger>, which are currently not
possible to display.

A separate file, enriched.doc, contains further documentation and other
important information about this code.  It also serves as an example
file in text/enriched format.  It should be in the etc directory of your
emacs distribution.")

 :commentary "\
This file enables flyspell checking in the idle cycle. Add

(require 'flyspell-timer)
(add-hook 'flyspell-mode-hook 'flyspell-timer-ensure-idle-timer)

to your .emacs. `flyspell-timer-mode' is also checked, so set this
to nil buffer-local if you want to disable this in some
buffers. Other configuration are `flyspell-timer-chunk-size' and
`flyspell-timer-delay'.  The system checks the former number of
words in each direction and then delays for the later number of
seconds. These are set conservatively, as flyspell can be fairly
intensive. Only displayed words (not the whole buffer) are checked
for much the same reason. Finally
`flyspell-timer-idle-timer-verbose' switches of the error
messages. These default to on, again, because this mode is CPU
intensive.")

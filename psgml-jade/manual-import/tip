Thanks:

The code is heavily borrowed from AUCTeX 9.5. 

Patches to make psgml-jade work on Windows NT are due to 
Dr. Markus Hoenicka (Hoenicka@pbmail.me.kp.dlr.de)


Installation:

This file requires Gnu Emacs or XEmacs, together with Lennart
Staflin's PSGML mode (tested with version 1.0.1) and David Megginson's 
DSSSL extensions (psgml-dsssl.el). I have tested it with GNU Emacs 19.34
and GNU Emacs 20.2.1

Install this file somewhere on your load path, byte-compile it, and
include the following in your .emacs or site-start.ed file:

 (add-hook 'sgml-mode-hook '(lambda () (require 'psgml-jade)))

Make the file `customize.dtd' accessible to jade and psgml. This
typically means adding a catalog entry for this file.

Now, whenever you are editing an SGML document with PSGML, you will
see an additional menu with title `DSSSL'. It contains entries 

 `Jade'       calls jade with sensible command line parameters
 `JadeTeX'    calls jadetex with sensible command line parameters
 `View dvi'   calls `xdvi' by default
 `Kill Job'   kills a job started with one of the above entries
 `Recenter Output Buffer'    displays the output of a job started 
              with one of the above entries.
 `File Options >'    opens a submenu that allows you to select the 
              DSSSL style sheet and the backend to use with jade.
 `Make new style sheet'    executes David Megginson's `sgml-dsssl-make-spec'
              for this you need the file `psgml-dsssl.el'.
 `Edit style sheet'    brings up a buffer with the selected style sheet.
 `Customize style sheet'   If the style sheet is following the DTD
              `customize.dtd' distributed with this file, this contains
              a submenu for changing variable settings in the style sheet.
 `Save customizations'     Asks you for the name of a file to save the
              customized values to. The generated file is a fully valid
              DSSSL style sheet. You may reload your customizations from 
              this file by selecting it as style sheet. 

The menu entries (except `File Options >') are also reachable by commands:
`M-x sgml-command' prompts you for the command to execute. You can use 
   completion to select one of the menu entries for the external commands.
`M-x sgml-recenter-output-buffer'
`M-x sgml-kill-job' 
`M-x sgml-dsssl-make-spec'
`M-x sgml-dsssl-edit-spec'

For details how to add commands to the menu, see the documentation of
the variables below.")

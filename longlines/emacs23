 :commentary "\
Some text editors save text files with long lines, and they
automatically break these lines at whitespace, without actually
inserting any newline characters.  When doing `M-q' in Emacs, you
are inserting newline characters.  Longlines mode provides a file
format which wraps the long lines when reading a file and unwraps
the lines when saving the file.  It can also wrap and unwrap
automatically as editing takes place.

Special thanks to Rod Smith for many useful bug reports.")

You can use the commands defined here to select different kinds of

   `mark-enclosing-sexp-backward', `mark-enclosing-sexp-forward',
   `mark-thing', `next-visible-thing', `next-visible-thing-repeat',
   `previous-visible-thing', `previous-visible-thing-repeat',
   `select-thing-near-point', `thgcmd-bind-keys', `thing-region'.

 User options defined here:

 Put this in your init file (`~/.emacs'):

  (require 'thing-cmds)
  (thgcmd-bind-keys) ; Only if you want the key bindings it defines

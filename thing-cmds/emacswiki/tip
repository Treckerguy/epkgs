You can use the commands defined here to select different kinds of
 text entities (\"things\").  They are especially useful in
 combination with Transient Mark mode.

 Commands defined here:

   `cycle-thing-region', `mark-thing', `select-thing-near-point',
   `thing-region'.

 User options defined here:

   `thing-types'.

 Internal variables defined here:

   `mark-thing-type', `thing-region-index'.

 Put this in your init file (`~/.emacs'): (require 'thing-cmds)

 Suggested key bindings (these will replace the standard bindings
 for `mark-sexp' and `mark-word'):

 (global-set-key [(control meta ? )] 'mark-thing) ; vs `mark-sexp'
 (global-set-key [(meta ?@)] 'cycle-thing-region) ; vs `mark-word'")

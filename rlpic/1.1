Picture-mode is handy for editing ASCII maps, such as are sometimes
used in roguelike games.  Try: M-x picture-mode <RET> C-h m

Even if the map takes up only a part of the file, one can
narrow-to-region on that region and edit it in picture mode.

Don't forget about the ability to insert the same character
multiple times by using the prefix argument.
rlpic-insert-feature-character supports this too.

I've only included the characters for the map of Rampart.  Other
character sets could be created by hand, but IMO it makes more
sense to wait for a more programmable way of defining maps and to
automatically generate characters from that.

Entry points:

rlpic-mode (Dummy function, just forwards to picture mode)
rlpic-show-character-meaning
rlpic-insert-feature-character
rlpic-show-feature-character
rlpic-fill-rectangle
rlpic-show-all-symbols

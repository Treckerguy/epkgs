 :commentary "\
Gnuserv is run when Emacs needs to operate as a server for other
processes.  Specifically, any number of files can be attached for
editing to a running XEmacs process using the `gnuclient' program.

Use `M-x gnuserv-start' to start the server and `gnuclient files'
to load them to XEmacs.  When you are done with a buffer, press
`C-x #' (`M-x gnuserv-edit').  You can put (gnuserv-start) to your
.emacs, and enable `gnuclient' as your Unix \"editor\".  When all the
buffers for a client have been edited and exited with
`gnuserv-edit', the client \"editor\" will return to the program that
invoked it.

Your editing commands and Emacs' display output go to and from the
terminal or X display in the usual way.  If you are running under
X, a new X frame will be open for each gnuclient.  If you are on a
TTY, this TTY will be attached as a new device to the running
XEmacs, and will be removed once you are done with the buffer.

To evaluate a Lisp form in a running Emacs, use the `-eval'
argument of gnuclient.  To simplify this, we provide the `gnudoit'
shell script.  For example `gnudoit \"(+ 2 3)\"' will print `5',
whereas `gnudoit \"(gnus)\"' will fire up your favorite newsreader.
Like gnuclient, `gnudoit' requires the server to be started prior
to using it.

For more information you can refer to man pages of gnuclient,
gnudoit and gnuserv, distributed with XEmacs.

gnuserv.el was originally written by Andy Norman as an improvement
over William Sommerfeld's server.el.  Since then, a number of
people have worked on it, including Bob Weiner, Darell Kindred,
Arup Mukherjee, Ben Wing and Jan Vroonhof.  It was completely
rewritten (labeled as version 3) by Hrvoje Niksic in May 1997.  The
new code will not run on GNU Emacs.

Jan Vroonhof <vroonhof@math.ethz.ch> July/1996
ported the server-temp-file-regexp feature from server.el
ported server hooks from server.el
ported kill-*-query functions from server.el (and made it optional)
synced other behavior with server.el

Jan Vroonhof
    Customized.

Hrvoje Niksic <hniksic@xemacs.org> May/1997
    Completely rewritten.  Now uses `defstruct' and other CL stuff
    to define clients cleanly.  Many thanks to Dave Gillespie!

Mike Scheidler <c23mts@eng.delcoelect.com> July, 1997
    Added 'Done' button to the menubar.")

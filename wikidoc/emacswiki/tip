 :commentary "\
This is for making documentation from Elisp doc strings. It is
intended as an alternative to using info.

Right now, the only output format is creole-wiki. But that could
change.

Source code

The wikidoc source code is not in a public repo yet.

Style note

This codes uses the emacs style of:

   wikidoc---private-function 

for private functions.

Examples

This is the main paragraph converter:

(wikidoc--convert \"this is a function.
 this is an example
 this should 'not' be changed to a link
This is the main text. It can include references to other 'functions'.
When there are 'two' references 'on the same line' it should
still work.\")

 :commentary "\
Defines a major mode for visiting image files
that allows conversion between viewing the text of the file
and viewing the file as an image.  Viewing the image
works by putting a `display' text-property on the
image data, with the image-data still present underneath; if the
resulting buffer file is saved to another name it will correctly save
the image data to the new file.")

The X'ABCD' notation is a string representation of bytes which
 uses only the characters 0-9 and a to f, i.e. the hexadecimal

 number (meaning that the X'ABCD' notation has exactly double the
 size of the bytes it represents). The format is used by SQLite for
 passing binary data over the command line (and possibly")

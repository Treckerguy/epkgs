 :commentary "\
This started out life a small collection of tools related to MP3
files, but it has since evolved into a simple MP3 Tag editor.

 Currently there is only support for editting the information in
one file at a time - but I shall be adding the ability to edit
all the files in a directory soon.

 In addition to the editor there is a nice function for creating
playlists - recursively adding every MP3 file it can find to the
list.")

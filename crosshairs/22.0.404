 :commentary "\
This library highlights the current line and the current column.
 It combines the features of libraries `hl-line.el', `hl-line+.el',
 and `col-highlight.el', which let you highlight the line or column
 individually.  See those libraries for more information.

 Command `crosshairs-mode' toggles this highlighting on and off.
 You can do this twice in succession to flash the crosshairs to
 show you where the cursor is.  An alternative way to
 flash-highlight is to use command `flash-crosshairs' (once).

 Command `crosshairs-highlight' shows crosshairs highlighting until
 your next action (next command, technically).  Command
 `crosshairs-unhighlight' turns off crosshairs highlighting due to
 `crosshairs-highlight'.

 With no prefix arg, command `crosshairs' is
 `crosshairs-highlight'.  With a prefix arg, it is
 `crosshairs-mode'.

 You can also have crosshairs highlighting come on automatically,
 when Emacs is idle.  Command `toggle-crosshairs-when-idle' toggles
 this mode.


 See also:

 * Library `hl-line+.el', which highlights the current line.

 * Library `col-highlight.el', which highlights the current column.

 * Library `cursor-chg.el' or library `oneonone.el', to change the
   cursor type when Emacs is idle.

This file defines a WebJump hotlist, `webjump-plus-sites', to supplement
your personal hotlist and the sample hotlist defined in `webjump.el'.
Included here are Web site entries that do not really belong in
`webjump.el', but that may save people from having to reinvent the wheel.
This package will be updated more frequently than `webjump.el'.

To use WebJump and `webjump-plus', you may wish to add something like the
following to your `.emacs' file:

  (require 'webjump-plus)
  (global-set-key \"\\C-cj\" 'webjump)
  (setq webjump-sites
        (append '(
                  (\"My Home Page\" . \"www.someisp.foo/users/joebobjr/\")
                  (\"Pop's Site\"   . \"www.joebob-and-son.foo/\")
                  )
                webjump-plus-sites
                webjump-sample-sites))

The above loads this package (and also the `webjump' package), binds `C-c j'
to invoke WebJump, and adds your personal favorite sites to the hotlist.

TODO: I really must made a certain couple syntax tweaks to `webjump.el'.")

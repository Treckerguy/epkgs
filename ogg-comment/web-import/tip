This file provides a minimal interface to reading the \"comment\"
section from an Ogg-Vorbis stream as defined in <URL:
http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/doc/Vorbis_I_spec.html>
It relies on all the comments being in the first 28kilobytes of
the file, thus removing the need to read the whole ogg file into
an Emacs buffer.

The implementation is rather \"byte-oriented\", due to the way the
Ogg-Vorbis file headers are specified.  Any improvements in making
the implementation more emacsy would be welcomed.

Installation:
To use, put this file somewhere in your `load-path' and do
(require 'ogg-comment).
You can then read ogg comments from a file by doing:
M-x oggc-show-header RET.

This file is mainly designed to be used in conjunction with
mp3player.el <URL: http://www.nongnu.org/mp3player/>, and its
followup EMMS <URL: http://www.gnu.org/software/emms/>.")

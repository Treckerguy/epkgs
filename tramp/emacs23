 :commentary "\
This package provides remote file editing, similar to ange-ftp.
The difference is that ange-ftp uses FTP to transfer files between
the local and the remote host, whereas tramp.el uses a combination
of rsh and rcp or other work-alike programs, such as ssh/scp.

For more detailed instructions, please see the info file.

Notes:
-----

This package only works for Emacs 22.1 and higher, and for XEmacs 21.4
and higher.  For XEmacs 21, you need the package `fsf-compat' for
the `with-timeout' macro.

Also see the todo list at the bottom of this file.

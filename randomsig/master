This is yet another implementation to insert a randomly choosen 
signature into a mail.

It is only tested with gnus.

To make it work, put the following lines into your ~/.gnus:

(require 'randomsig)
(define-key message-mode-map (kbd \"C-c s\") 'randomsig-replace-sig)
(define-key message-mode-map (kbd \"C-c S\") 'randomsig-select-sig)
(require 'gnus-sum) ; probably required for `gnus-summary-save-map'
(define-key gnus-summary-save-map \"-\" 'gnus/randomsig-summary-read-sig)
(setq randomsig-dir \"/some/directory\")
(setq randomsig-files '(\"some\" \"files\"))
;; or (setq randomsig-files (randomsig-search-sigfiles))
;; or (setq randomsig-files 'randomsig-search-sigfiles)
(setq message-signature 'randomsig-signature)

This will also define the shortcut `C-c s' in message-mode to
change the signature, `C-c S' in message-mode to interactively
select the signature to replace the current signature, and `O -' in
gnus-summary-mode to read the signature from the selected mail.

`randomsig-files' must be a list of existing files, an existing
file, or a function returning a list of existing files. If these
don't have absolute paths, they are located in `randomsig-dir'.

File format: Each file must contain at least one signature.
Signatures are separated with `randomsig-delimiter-pattern'. If
there is only one signature in the file, the delimiter can be
omitted, so real .signature-files can be used.

`randomsig-delimiter' is used when inserting new signatures with
`randomsig-message-read-sig' into the signature file. So
`randomsig-delimiter' should match `randomsig-delimiter-pattern'.

`randomsig-static-string' is put in front of every random signature
if non-`nil'.

The *-read-sig functions read the signature of a message, or use
the marked text, and write it to a signature-file, for which the
name is asked. If the file does not exist, it will be generated.
When called with any prefix, the signatures will be offered to edit
before saving.

if `randomsig-replace-sig' is called with any prefix, it will ask
for a file to get the signature from.

`randomsig-select-sig' will offer a list of signatures to select
from in an extra buffer. n will jump to the next signature, p to
the previous, RET will insert the selected signature, q will exit
the selection buffer without replacing the current signature, R
will reload the signature-files, and e will open a buffer for
editing the signature at the point. When called with any prefix, it
will ask for a file to get the signatures from

`randomsig-search-sigfiles' will search for regular files in
`randomsig-dir', which do not match `randomsig-search-unwanted'. A
subdirectory of `randomsig-dir' can be given as optional argument.

Completion will only work for files in `randomsig-files', though
others files can be used, too.")

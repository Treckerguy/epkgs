 :commentary "\
This program provides a mode-sensitive command for commenting out
regions of program text.  It can also be used to quote regions of mail
messages.

To use this, put it somewhere in your load path and add the following
lines to your .emacs:

         (autoload 'comment-out-region \"comment\" nil t)
         (global-set-key \"\\C-cq\" 'comment-out-region)

With this binding, you can reverse the action (i.e uncomment) a
region by supplying a universal prefix argument, i.e. `C-u C-c q'.")

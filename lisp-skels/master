 :commentary "\
This module is pretty simple: It's a bunch of skeletons as per
skeleton.el, a list so that expand.el can interoperate with it, and
1 keymap so you can quickly call the skeletons manually.

Try these skeletons with a prefix of -1 (Usually bound to M--) and
a hylited region:  They'll wrap around it.  It's often useful.")

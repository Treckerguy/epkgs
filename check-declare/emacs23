 :commentary "\
The byte-compiler often warns about undefined functions that you
know will actually be defined when it matters.  The `declare-function'
statement allows you to suppress these warnings.  This package
checks that all such statements in a file or directory are accurate.
The entry points are `check-declare-file' and `check-declare-directory'.

For more information, see Info node `elisp(Declaring Functions)'.")

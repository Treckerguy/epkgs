 :commentary "\
backpack.el is intended to be an Emacs interface to Backpack. At the
moment, it's an undocumented, fairly bare-bones, but complete
implementation of the Backpack API. I'll be adding a UI soon.

Please set `backpack-username' and `backpack-api-key' appropriately.

I've been developing this under a fairly recent build of Emacs' CVS
HEAD. There are known incompatibilities between this code and XEmacs'
versions of url.el and xml.el.

You may have noticed the lack of adequate documentation. It's on the
way, but for now, you can use the Backpack API docs:

               <URL:http://www.backpackit.com/api/>

Share and Enjoy!")

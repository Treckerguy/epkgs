 :commentary "\
This adds support for definitions in a muse project. There are two new tags
added. The first \"<define>\" adds a word into a page which should be defined
and, optionally an inline definition. The second \"<definition>\" is used to
provide an definition for when inline definitions are not enough.

For example,

<define link=\"word\">a set of letters surrounded by spaces</define>

defines \"word\" as \"a set of...\".

Alternatively, we could do

<define link=\"word\"/>

<definition name=\"word\">a set of letters surrounded by spaces</definition>

The \"<definition> tag can occur anywhere in the same muse project.
In general, they can be placed in a single file, which acts as a glossary.
Any other muse markup can be used in this file; when published the
\"<definition>\" tag is removed.

Note the one limitation here -- the definition used by the \"<define>\" tag
will be the one present in the \"<definition>\" tag, the last time the latter
was published -- essentially, it's a two stage compiliation. You can use
a third tag to overcome this.

<defdepend file=\"definitions.muse\"/>

will ensure that all definitions in \"definitions.muse\" are current. You can
include this tag into your header and footer if you like using like so...

<markup>
<defdepend file=\"definitions.muse\"/>
</markup>

The <defdepend> tag needs to be on a new line or it doesn't work (for me at
least).")

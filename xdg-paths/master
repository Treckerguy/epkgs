This package sets the directory according to the XDG Base
Directory Specification.  The directories are given by the
environment variables, falling back to the defaults enumerated
in the standard.

The $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR was not contemplated here, since we found
no practical use for it.

The defaults (or generated values) are:

         Symbol                         Default
 user-emacs-data-directory     ~/.local/share/emacs/
 user-emacs-config-directory   ~/.config/emacs/
 user-emacs-cache-directory    ~/.cache/emacs/
 user-emacs-lisp-directory     `user-emacs-data-directory`/lisp
 user-documents-directory      ~/Documents

Some convenience functions are defined to locate files in these
directories and to add user lisp to load-path.

Some advantages are:

Installation:

  1. put xdg-paths in your own path.
  2. Start your .emacs with (load-library 'xdg-paths) or,
     write (load-library 'xdg-paths) in site-start.el")

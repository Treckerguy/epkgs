ABOUT:

    BBDBpalm exports your BBDB address database to your Palm/USR/3Com
    Pilot/PalmPilot/Palm-Connected-Organizer (hereinafter simply \"Palm\").
    BBDB is a sort of electronic address book written by Jamie Zawinsky
    <jwz@jwz.org> that integrates nicely with Emacs-based E-mail and Usenet
    clients.  BBDBpalm lets you bring that address book with you if you
    don't have the luxury of 24/7 network access to a remote Emacs session
    from your Palm.

    The Web page is `http://www.neilvandyke.org/bbdbpalm/'.

    This package is no longer being maintained.

REQUIREMENTS:

    BBDBpalm was developed with BBDB 1.51, which is available at
    `http://www.jwz.org/bbdb/' if you don't already have it.  It has also
    been reported to work with BBDB 2.00.02.

    BBDBpalm uses the `pilot-addresses' program, which is part of the
    Pilot-Link package.  Pilot-Link is freely available on the 'net, and is
    included with some GNU/Linux distributions.  The master sources are
    available at `ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/', although you may
    wish to instead find a pre-compiled distribution for your operating
    system.  BBDBpalm was tested with version 0.9.0.

    BBDBpalm was developed under GNU Emacs 20.3 running atop the GNU/Linux
    platform.  It will probably work with Emacs 19 and has been reported to
    work under XEmacs 21.2b17.  It will probably work under Emacs on other
    Unix variants.  Please let me know if you encounter any problems with
    other Emacsen or Unixen.

INSTALLATION:

    If you're Emacs-savvy enough to be using BBDB, then you probably don't
    need much install instructions.  The only three non-obvious things you
    need to do are:

      1. On your Palm, add an Address List category called \"BBDB\", in all
         caps.  (Reason: Unfortunately, `pilot-addresses' does not presently
         create categories on your Palm, or overwrite duplicate entries.
         So, every time we upload to the Palm, we blast everything in the
         \"BBDB\" category and put all the BBDB-exported records into that
         category.)  If you change entries on the Palm side of things,
         change their category so that you remember to manually propagate
         the change to BBDB.

      2. If you don't want to export everything in your BBDB to the Palm,
         then do both of:

           a. Put the following your `.emacs' file or wherever you put your
              Emacs customizations:

                  (setq bbdbpalm-export-all-p nil)

           b. Add a field called `palm' to each BBDB record that you wish to
              export (by pressing `C-o' in the `*BBDB*' buffer with the
              point on the desired record).  Give each `palm' field a value
              of `yes' for now.  Note that a later version of BBDBpalm might
              put something else in that field.

      3. If you wish to have titles for people be exported to the Palm, add
         a field called `title' to BBDB and use it.

ALTERNATIVES:

    Tom Fawcett <fawcett@basit.com> wrote `bbdb-pilot', which is available
    at `ftp://ftp.croftj.net/usr/fawcett/bbdb-pilot.el'.  The version I
    found, dated 1998, didn't seem to do what I wanted (I'm so picky) but
    you may prefer it.

    Neale Picket <zephyr@roguetrader.com> hacked up a small convertor in
    Feb-1998.  See `http://acm.rpi.edu/~albert/pilot/Feb98/0039.html'.

THINGS TO DO:

    * Add support for custom fields.

    * Add special support for `Web' custom field.

    * Maybe someday do bidirectional sync-ing.  For now, users should just
      keep all the BBDB-exported records in the `BBDB' category on their
      Palm, and manually change those records on the BBDB end rather than on
      the Palm end.

    * Maybe I should make it fix certain family names that BBDB has
      mis-parsed, such as, well... I dunno... how about... \"Van Dyke\"?
      Better yet, I should move to BBDB 2.x and make sure it's fixed there.

    * Make it be smarter about which address it picks if there are multiple
      ones.

    * Add BBDB extension so that it prompts you for `palm' field.

    * Make it reformat phone numbers.

    * Add completion-percentage indicator for file-exporting and uploading.

    * Check for error from `pilot-addresses' and maybe do something with it.

    * ``I think it would be nice if the order of phone numbers as they
      appear in the BBDB was preserved in the Pilot. Same thing for multiple
      email addresses; they are now listed in reverse order.''  [Mark Moll
      <mmoll@cs.cmu.edu>, 24-Jun-1999]

    * ``Maybe it's a good idea to put in a message \"Please press the HotSync
      button\" at the appropiate time.''  [Mark Moll <mmoll@cs.cmu.edu>,
      24-Jun-1999]")

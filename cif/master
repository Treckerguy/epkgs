 :commentary "\
Has a superset (roughly) of the useful functionality of a version
done by Martyn Winn.  This is a completely different implementation
which is more Emacs-canonical in interface and implementation, is
simpler, and is GPLed.

Functionality: Font Lock, Imenu, Which Function, loops and data
blocks as functions, skeleton commands.  Potentially useful for
dictionaries too, since it also supports save_ stuff.  Also examples
of transformation commands similar to the PDB versions.

Probably requires Emacs 21.  Needs font-lock on to deal properly
with the syntax.

Consider in .emacs:
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.cif\\\\'\" . cif-mode))
  (autoload 'cif-mode \"cif\")

etags recipe for dictionary:  etags -r '/save_\\([^ ]+\\)/\\1/' ...")

Allows backup files to be optionally stored in some directories, based on
the value of the alist, `bkup-backup-directory-info'.  This variable is a
list of lists of the form (FILE-REGEXP BACKUP-DIR OPTIONS ...).  If the
filename to be backed up matches FILE-REGEXP, or FILE-REGEXP is t, then
BACKUP-DIR is used as the path for its backups.  Directories may begin
with \"/\" to specify an absolute pathname.

If BACKUP-DIR does not exist and OPTIONS contains the symbol `ok-create',
then it is created if possible.  Otherwise the usual behavior (backup in
the same directory as the file) results.

If OPTIONS contains the symbol `full-path', then the full path of the file
being backed up is prepended to the backup file name, with each \"/\"
replaced by a \"!\".  This is intended for cases where an absolute backup
path is used.  If OPTIONS contains `prepend-name' in addition to
`full-path', then the file name is prepended rather than appended to the
path component when forming the backup name.

If OPTIONS contains the symbol `search-upward' and the backup directory
BACKUP-DIR is a relative path, then a directory with that name is searched
for starting at the current directory and proceeding upward (.., ../..,
etc) until one is found of that name or the root is reached, and if one is
found it is used as the backup directory.

Finally, if no FILE-REGEXP matches the file name being backed up, then the
usual behavior results.

These lines from my .emacs load this file and set the values I like:

(require 'backup-dir)
(setq bkup-backup-directory-info
      '((\"/home/greg/.*\" \"/~/.backups/\" ok-create full-path prepend-name)
        (\"^/[^/:]+:\"     \".backups/\") ; handle EFS files specially: don't
        (\"^/[^/:]+:\"     \"./\")        ; search-upward... its very slow
        (t               \".backups/\"
                         full-path prepend-name search-upward)))


The package also provides a new function, `find-file-latest-backup' to
find the latest backup file for the current buffer's file.

This package is based on `files.el' from XEmacs 20.3 and overrides
functions defined there.  The overridden functions are clearly
marked below and the originals precede the new definitions in
commented form.

The package is known to work in the latest XEmacs betas.  It has
not been extensively tested on GNU Emacs past 18.58, though I have
reports of it working through 20.2.  It does not work under ms-dos.")

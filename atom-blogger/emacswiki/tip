{{{  introduction

Simple wrapper using Curl to post/edit Blogger.com Blogs
This module will provide commands that prompt for the auth
token and Feed/Entry URL,
and pass it on to Curl.
The XML results will be placed in a buffer in xml mode.
nxml-mode is highly recommend and will be used if available.

Usage:

atom-blogger-new-entry          Create a new entry
atom-blogger-post-entry         Publish newly created entry
atom-blogger-edit-entry         Edit existing entry.
atom-blogger-put-entry          Publish edits when ready.

Commands prompt for the URI of the entry being manipulated ---
this is the service.edit URI.
You can customize things via custom, most useful being
atom-blogger-default-auth which can be set to a user:password
pair to avoid repeated prompting.

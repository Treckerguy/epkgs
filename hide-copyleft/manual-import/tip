I sometimes find it tiresome to have fifteen lines of copyright notice at
the beginning of each file.  Meta-< does not take you to the beginning of
the code, it takes you a windowfull or two away, which can be tedious on
slow terminal lines.

I know what the copyright notice says; so this code makes all but the first
line of it be invisible, by using Emacs's selective-display feature.  The
text is still present and unmodified, but it is invisible.

Elide the copyright notice with \"Meta-X hide-copyleft-region\".  Make it
visible again with \"Control-U Meta-X hide-copyleft-region\".  Or, if you're
sure you're not gonna get sued, you can do something like this in your
.emacs file:

(autoload 'hide-copyleft-region   \"hide-copyleft\" nil t)
(autoload 'unhide-copyleft-region \"hide-copyleft\" nil t)
(mapcar '(lambda (hook) (add-hook hook 'hide-copyleft-region))
	   '(emacs-lisp-mode-hook lisp-mode-hook
	     cperl-mode-hook perl-mode-hook c-mode-hook
          autolisp-mode-hook))
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'hide-copyleft-region)
(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'hide-copyleft-region)
(global-set-key \"\\C-ch\" 'hide-copyleft-mode)

This code (obviously) has quite specific knowledge of the wording of the 
various copyrights I've run across.  Let me know if you find one on which
it fails.

Todo: 
  go the into the © mode, say show © in the statusline, only iff a 
  message was hidden.")

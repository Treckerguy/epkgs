 :commentary "\
This mode builds upon Emacs's VC mode to provide flexible
integration with the BitKeeper software configuration management
product.

To get going as quickly as possible, load this file into Emacs and
type `C-c b h', which runs bk-help-overview, which prints a helpful
usage overview.

Much of the inspiration for bk.el comes from Rajesh
Vaidheeswarran's excellent p4.el, which does an admirably thorough
job for the Perforce SCM product.  In fact, substantial chunks of
code are adapted from p4.el.

This code has been developed under XEmacs 21.4, and probably will
not work as well under GNU Emacs (albeit tested under 21.2).
Patches to enhance the portability of this code, fix bugs, and add
features are most welcome.  You can obtain a BitKeeper repository
for this package by cloning bk://bk-emacs.bkbits.net/emacs

Please send problem reports and suggestions to bos@serpentine.com.")

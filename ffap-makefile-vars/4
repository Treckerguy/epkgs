 :commentary "\
This spot of code lets M-x ffap expand makefile macros $(FOO) in a
filename, like

    PREFIX = /usr

    $(PREFIX)/share/foo

With point on the \"$(PREFIX)/share/foo\" an M-x ffap expands to offer
\"/usr/share/foo\".  This is good for constructed filenames in makefiles.

Macros are expanded from the definitions in the file and also from
`process-environment' like \"make\" does.  There's no support for the
various smart expansions GNU make can do though.")

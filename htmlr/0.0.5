History
0.0.5
 - support for dl dd dt tags
 - fixes new line problems
 - other fixes
0.0.4
 - support for h1..h6, ol tags
 - more style variables
 - highlight for link and img tags
 - more fixes
0.0.3
 - change the behaviour of the parser. It now uses the content
 of the stack for the transitions an not last-tag. 
 - as a result, all tags but empty tags (img, hr ...)  and closing
tags must be pushed.
- transition definitions are more compact because we don't need
  transition from closing tag anymore
- stack now contains the position of the beginning of the tag
- introduce htmlr-last-wrap-pos variable to keep track of what
 has allready been wrap
- bugs treat space around <img> <a> <b> etc.. a trick solution
  but a \\n if we need a space because \\n are replace by space by
  wrap while space are erased.
- add the bullet list definition for sublist + * - etc...
- other small fixes

0.0.2
 - added whatever tag  to limit the complexity of the  definition 
       of htmlr-transitions.  
 - added support for links [src text]. better highlight needed
 - added support for images {src (alt | name)} better highlight needed
 - added support for i, em, hr, br, tags")

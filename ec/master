Ok, you wanted some comments:
ec.el is my first emacs lisp program written. So don't lough too
loud about it when using it. Thanks.
this is a very beta version of ec.el. Please do not use this
filenmanager if you have data that you want to keep!!!! This
filemanager has probably a lot of bugs (and I know of some!) . So
the chance of data loss is rather high! 
If the previous sentences do not keep you from trying this code,
here are some notes:

Installation:
============
Put ec.el somewhere in the loadpath of your one and only editor
(aka emacs) and put the following line in your .emacs:

(autoload 'ec \"ec\" \"ec - evening commander.\" t nil)

(without the two ';;' certainly). Then start the evening commander
with 'M-x ec'.

Features:
========

(write some features here :-) XXX

* full mouse support (incl. wheelmouse: button 4 and 5)  
* easy navigation with cursor keys, f2 and direct i-search
* context menu on right mouse button lets the user invoke 
  external programs such as the acrobat reader for pdf files


Todo: 
=====

since this is an early beta version, there is a *whole* lot
to do! I would be happy if you send me your ideas or even better,
just implement them! Search for XX if you want something to do!

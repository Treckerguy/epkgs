The entry point, `rot13-other-window', performs a Caesar cipher
encrypt/decrypt on the current buffer and displays the result in another
window.  ROT13 encryption is sometimes used on USENET as a read-at-your-
own-risk wrapper for material some might consider offensive, such as
ethnic humor.

Written by Howard Gayle.
This hack is mainly to show off the char table stuff.

New entry points, `rot13', `rot13-string', and `rot13-region' that
performs Ceasar cipher encrypt/decrypt on buffers and strings, was
added by Simon Josefsson.")

* An (ab)use of abbrev-mode.
* Written as a Christmas gift for James, who likes StudlyCaps.
* When StudlyCaps is activated it adds the current set of
  StudlyCapped words in the buffer to the global abbrev
  table.
* If you use new StudlyCapped words rescan the buffer
  or use the function StudlyCaps-add-word-at-point.
  (global-set-key [f6] 'StudlyCaps-add-word-at-point)

TODO: When reading the db not all the words are in StudlyCaps.")

Enhancements of standard library `files.el'.

 Commands defined here:

   `dired-describe-listed-directory',
   `dired-mouse-describe-listed-directory',


 ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `files.el' have been
             REDEFINED HERE:

 `display-buffer-other-frame' - Use `read-buffer'.
                                Do not select the buffer.
 `find-file-read-args' - In Dired, use file at cursor as default.
 `insert-directory' - Add file count in Dired for each dir listed.
 `switch-to-buffer-other-frame'  - Use `read-buffer'.
                                   Return the buffer switched to.
 `switch-to-buffer-other-window' -
    Use `read-buffer'.
    Raise frame of selected window (for non-nil `pop-up-frames').

 Load this library after loading the standard library `files.el'.
 However, if you use MS Windows, MS-DOS, or MacOS, then you will
 likely want to use library `ls-lisp+.el' together with
 `files+.el', to use an Emacs Lisp-only definition of
 `insert-directory'.

 In that case, do *NOT* load `files+.el' directly.  Instead, just
 load `ls-lisp+.el' - it will load `ls-lisp.el' and `files+.el'.
 That is, do only this in your init file:

  (require 'ls-lisp+)")

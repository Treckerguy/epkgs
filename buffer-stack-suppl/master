 :commentary "\
Change buffer-stack default behaviour to only bubble through buffers of the
same major-mode.  Switching between all buffers is done with new *-thru-all
functions.

Put this file into your load-path and the following into your ~/.emacs:

  (require 'buffer-stack-suppl)

  (global-set-key [(f10)] 'buffer-stack-bury)
  (global-set-key [(control f10)] 'buffer-stack-bury-and-kill)
  (global-set-key [(f9)] 'buffer-stack-up)
  (global-set-key [(f11)] 'buffer-stack-down)
  (global-set-key [(shift f10)] 'buffer-stack-bury-thru-all)
  (global-set-key [(shift f9)] 'buffer-stack-up-thru-all)
  (global-set-key [(shift f11)] 'buffer-stack-down-thru-all)")

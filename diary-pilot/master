This program installs all of the events from the Emacs diary for
 the next N days (default 365) to the pilot datebook and then
 removes duplicates from the pilot datebook.  Yep, very hacky!

 Note that most versions of install-datebook have a bug that stops
 them handling events without an end time.  Bummer, huh?  If yours
 is broken and you want to know the fix, then please send me
 e-mail.

 INSTALLATION
   To install, simply copy this file into a directory in your
   load-path and add the following command in your .emacs file:

   (autoload 'diary-to-pilot \"diary-pilot\" \"Export Emacs diary to palm pilot\" t)")

This is yet another citing engine for Emacs.  It's to trivial-cite
what trivial-cite is to supercite (i.e. stripped down).  I wrote it
because, well, I wanted to see if I could.  Doesn't do any fancy
guessing of cite-prefixes, just tacks a \">\" on the front of the
quoted article.  See the docstrings of `cite-cite' and
`cite-parse-headers' for information on extending cite.

Installation:
To use this package, you have to make it the default citing
function: First make sure cite.el is somewhere on your `load-path',
then add: (autoload 'cite-cite \"cite\" \"A simple cite function for
Emacs\" nil) to your .emacs.

If you are a Gnus user:
In your ~/.gnus add
(setq message-cite-function 'cite-cite)
to make message call `cite-cite' to cite articles.
Since `cite-cite' also generates an attribution, you probably also
want to do:
(setq news-reply-header-hook nil)

or at least make sure that `news-reply-header-hook' doesn't call a
function which creates an attribution line.

If you are a VM user:
If you use Emacs' mail-mode to compose replies, add the following
to your ~/.vm
(setq mail-citation-hook 'cite-cite)")

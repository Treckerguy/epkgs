 :commentary "\
Provides a simple framework for snarfing the pestilential
Outlook-format appointments from mail messages in Gnus or Rmail
using command `diary-from-outlook'.  This, or specialized functions
`diary-from-outlook-gnus' and `diary-from-outlook-rmail', could be
run from hooks to notice appointments automatically (in which case
they will prompt about adding to the diary).
`gnus-article-prepare-hook' is probably the right one for Gnus; I
don't know about Rmail.

The message formats recognized are customizable through
`diary-outlook-formats', but this may be a losing battle generally,
given the variety of random formats such messages take, in the
usual MS way.  I think `diary-outlook-formats' doesn't currently
cover all the varieties I've received, but does most of them.
There's also a German example whose source I don't remember.")

 :commentary "\
The default behavior of undo is that when editing in one buffer, an
undo boundary is created in another buffer the first time it is edited.
This makes sense for interactive behavior, but it's not desirable when a
single interactive command creates multiple undo boundaries via
non-interactive buffer switches.  For example, calling rfc822-addresses
within an interactive command can cause this to happen.  Wrapping the call
to rfc822-address with this macro can prevent that.")

 :commentary "\
Emacs conveniently allows one to work on different parts of the same
buffer at the same time, but the rules governing buffer display are, for
some people's editing habits, less than ideal.  Suppose for example that
one is editing two parts of buffer <buf> in windows <win1> and <win2>,
switches briefly to another buffer in <win2>, then returns to editing
<buf> in <win2>.  This latter window will now display the same part of
<buf> as <win1>, rather than the portion that one was just recently
editing in it.  The Rebound package creates persistent values of point and
window-start, so that in cases like that just described <win2> will return
to its previous position in <buf>.

In some cases, as when another Lisp program wants to move point in a
buffer and then displays that buffer in a window, it makes sense for Rebound
not to position point in that window.  The package is reasonably
intelligent in identifying when that is so.  Further control is given by
the variables `rebound-reposition-temp-buffers' and
`rebound-reposition-tests'.

To install the package, put this file somewhere in your load path and put:

 (require 'rebound)

in your .emacs.  To toggle rebound on and off, use the command
`rebound-mode'.

This package has not been tested on versions earlier than v21.2.1.")

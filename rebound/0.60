 :commentary "\
Emacs conveniently allows one to work on different parts of the same
buffer at the same time, but the rules governing buffer display are, for
some people's editing habits, less than ideal.  Suppose for example that
one is editing two parts of buffer <buf> in windows <win1> and <win2>,
switches briefly to another buffer in <win2>, then returns to editing
<buf> in <win2>.  This latter window will now display the same part of
<buf> as <win1>, rather than the portion that one was just recently
editing in it.  Rebound creates persistent values of point and
window-start, so that in cases like that just described <win2> will return
to its previous position in <buf>.

In some cases, such as looking up a function definition via
`describe-function', it makes sense for Rebound to allow other Lisp
programs to fix the value of point.  The package is reasonably intelligent
in identifying when when it should do so.  Further control over
repositioning is provided by the variables `rebound-no-reposition-names',
`rebound-no-reposition-regexps', and `rebound-reposition-tests'.  Note
also that rebound always ignores minibuffer windows.

To install the package, put this file in your load path and put:

 (require 'rebound)

in your .emacs.  To toggle rebound on and off, use the command
`rebound-mode'.")

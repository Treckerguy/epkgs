 :commentary "\
This package provides a simple indentation engine for XML.  It is
intended for use in situations where the full power of the popular PSGML
package (DTD parsing, syntax checking) is not required.

xml-lite is designed to be used in conjunction with the default GNU
Emacs sgml-mode, to provide a lightweight XML-editing environment.

Updates will be made available at:
    http://www.bigfoot.com/~mdub/software/xml-lite.el

Note: the font-lock support that was in this package has been removed.")

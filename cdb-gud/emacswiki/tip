This package provides Emacs (GUD) integration for Microsoft's CDB
debugger.  (CDB is the text-mode version of WinDbg).  For more
details about the Emacs' debugger integration, read \"Running
Debuggers Under Emacs\" in the Emacs manual.

To install this package:

   - Download and install the latest version of the `Debugging Tools
     for Windows' from http://www.microsoft.com/ddk/debugging/.  Add it
     to your PATH environment.

   - Put the following into your .emacs file:

     (load \"cdb-gud\")

   - You can customize `gud-cdb-directories' to help GUD find your source
     files.

   - If you want key bindings similar to MS' GUI debuggers, add the
     following:

     (global-set-key [f5]    'gud-cont)
     (global-set-key [f7]    'gud-tbreak)
     (global-set-key [f8]    'gud-step)
     (global-set-key [f9]    'gud-break)
     (global-set-key [f10]   'gud-next)
     (global-set-key [f11]   'gud-finish)


Here is a simple tutorial:

In Emacs, run

   	M-x cdb
    \"Run cdb (like this):\" cdb <name of your exe>

This will open a new Emacs buffer \"*gud-xxx*\".  In it you will get a
CDB command prompt '0:000> '.  (CDB commands are documented in the
'Debugging tools for Windows' online help).  To get to the begin of
your code, type:

     'g main' <Enter> (or 'g WinMain' if you have a GUI application).

CDB will load the application and break at your main() function.
Emacs should open another window with your main() source file and show
a little '>' were the debugger stopped.  You now can set more
breakpoints in your sources, single-step, etc.  To use the common VC++

You can also issue additional commands from the CDB command prompt --
e.g.:

    - 'dv'  Displays local variables

    - 'dt' or '??' shows the content of a single variable.

To get the current stack trace, either use the 'k' command or execute
\"M-x speedbar\".  The later will display the calling stack in a
additional Emacs frame and you can use the mouse to switch between
stack frames.

If the little GUD source line marker '>' is hard to follow, add the
following to your .emacs:

;;-------------------------------------------------------------
;; Add color to the current GUD line
;;")

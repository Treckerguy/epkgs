COBOL -- COmmon Business Oriented Language. ()

This is currently a work-in-progress.  I believe comments and strings are
being handled correctly and some keywords are highlighted.  I'm only
posting this in such a crude stage as a method of synchronizing changes
among the various computers I might work on this from.  You are welcome to
try it and submit changes or report bugs but there is no point trying to
report lack of features or missing keywords unless you are including
patches that address such shortcomings.

Since I use this mode on Tandem/Guardian/NSK source files for Scobol and
Cobol this mode handles the extensions implemented by those compilers.
It may not correctly handle standard features that are not implemented
by those compilers.

I wrote this because I didn't like the only other Cobol mode I could find.
The other one is on the Azundris site.  It deletes periods and commas if
you don't change their syntax properties.  It also doesn't have anything
close to this version's handling of comments and strings.  But it does do
many things this one doesn't.  A given individual may decide either is the
lesser of two evils.  This one is certainly better than nothing.")

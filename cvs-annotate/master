 :commentary "\
For starters... YES I KNOW THERE ALREADY IS `vc-annotate'..  I didn't like
it (not that the author didn't do an amazing job it just wasn't my cup of
tea.)  I wanted a cvs-annotate that was similar to webcvs.  It
might be a good idea to merge these in the future.  vc-annotate colors the
whole buffer and leaves all the annotation information.  cvs-annotate tries
to remove redundant annotation lines and only marks the current revision.
You can highlight multiple revisions if you want.  cvs-annotate has
additional features as well.  It allows you to view the log entry for a
specific revision and the diff that was applied.

I would really love to see these modifications make it into the standard
emacs vc.el package.  Until that point it will be known as cvs-annotate.

Should this become part of pcl-cvs???

Requirements:

Emacs with ELib: http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/gnu/elib/elib.html

;; In order to use this.  You need to be open a file that is managed by CVS.
You can then run 'cvs-annotate' and another buffer will pop up with the cvs
annotation.")

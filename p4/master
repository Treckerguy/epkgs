WARNING:
--------

   % p4 edit foo.c
   ... make changes to foo.c in emacs
   % p4 submit
    ... keep the writable copy of foo.c in emacs.  Start making changes
    to it.  Discover that you can't save it.	 If you do M-x:p4-edit,
    you'll lose your changes.  You need to do a 'p4 edit' at the
    command-line.


NOTES:
------

It is best if you take this file and byte compile it. To do that, you
need to do the following:

% emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile /full/path/to/file/p4.el

This creates a binary file p4.elc in the path. Add the path to your
load-path variable in .emacs like this:

(setq load-path (cons \"/full/path/to/dir/containing/file\" load-path))

Then add the library like this:

(load-library \"p4\")")

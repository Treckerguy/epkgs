 :commentary "\
This package provides a simple method of inserting an URL based on the
text at point in the current buffer. This is part of an on-going effort
to increase the information I provide people while reducing the ammount
of typing I need to do. No-doubt there are undiscovered Emacs packages
out there that do all of this and do it better, feel free to point me to
them, in the mean time I'm having fun playing with Emacs Lisp.

The URLs are stored in an external file as a list of either cons cells,
or lists. A cons cell entry looks like this:

   (<Lookup> . <URL>)

where <Lookup> is a string that acts as the keyword lookup and <URL> is
the URL associated with it. An example might be:

   (\"GNU\" . \"http://www.gnu.org/\")

A list entry looks like:

   (<Lookup> <URL> <Comment>)

where <Lookup> and <URL> are the same as with the cons cell and <Comment>
is any text you like that describes the URL. This description will be
used when presenting a list of URLS using `quickurl-list'. An example
might be:

   (\"FSF\" \"http://www.fsf.org/\" \"The Free Software Foundation\")

Given the above, your quickurl file might look like:

((\"GNU\"    . \"http://www.gnu.org/\")
 (\"FSF\"      \"http://www.fsf.org/\" \"The Free Software Foundation\")
 (\"emacs\"  . \"http://www.emacs.org/\")
 (\"davep\"    \"http://www.davep.org/\" \"Dave's homepage\"))

In case you're wondering about the mixture of cons cells and lists,
quickurl started life using just the cons cells, there were no comments.
URL comments are a later addition and so there is a mixture to keep
backward compatibility with existing URL lists.

The name and location of the file is up to you, the default name used by
`quickurl' is stored in `quickurl-url-file'.

quickurl is always available from:

  <URL:http://www.davep.org/emacs/quickurl.el>")

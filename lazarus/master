Lazarus is a minor mode for opening files that have been closed.
The idea is to provide a 'web browser' sort of functionality to
recover from accidental kills. It provides several convenience
functions to this end. It also allows the conjuring of an interactive
buffer to manage or jump to the closed files.

Lazarus will save a list of closed files when you close Emacs, and
read them back in when you start the mode.

It will save the last 20 files that have been closed.

You can customize the file path and number of files saved
by M-x customize-group lazarus

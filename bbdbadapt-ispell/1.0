I wanted to have the ispell dict selected 
based on a relevant bbdb entry which I call ispell-dict.
This is what the code does. 

The starting point was some code provided to me by Robert
Fenk. However the problem with that code was that it took the gcc
field from some entry of the BBDB buffer and if there was more than
on entry often the wrong string was inserted. So I had to use code
which extracted the correct BBDB entry from the TO field .  I
succeeded by using to a large extend code from sigadapt.el written
by by C.Queinnec (University of Paris 6 & INRIA)")

 :commentary "\
This file is an add-on to labbook.el and provides additional
support for PGP signing of the labbook. This file uses MailCrypt
for the majority of its functionality. At the moment it can not
automatically indentify start of the signature, you have to set the
`labbook-sign-start-of-signature' variable up for this. Its
defaults to pgp 5.0.

Bugs

1) Not exactly a bug, but this uses the string which changelog
puts into the buffer at the begining of each entry. I didnt really
want this anyway and would want to remove it at some point, which
will of course screw up this functionality. At some point I would
like labbook.el to provide some sort of \"foward entry\"
functionality anyway, which would do what I want better.

Todo

1) The signature narrowing functions are frankly crap, and need to
be massively improved. Should pick through mail-crypt to find out
whether it provides this sort of additional functionality. Yes it
does! See code for `mc-verify-signature' which has stuff for doing this.
2) Need to fit stuff in for mailcrypt so that it verifies correctly.

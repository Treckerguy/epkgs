This package maintains a menu for visiting files that were operated
on recently.  When enabled a new \"Open Recent\" sub menu is
displayed in the \"File\" menu.  The recent files list is
automatically saved across Emacs sessions.  You can customize the
number of recent files displayed, the location of the menu and
others options (see the source code for details).

To enable this package, add the following to your .emacs:
(recentf-mode 1)")

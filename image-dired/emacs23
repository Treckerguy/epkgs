BACKGROUND
==========

 I needed a program to browse, organize and tag my pictures.  I got
tired of the old gallery program I used as it did not allow
multi-file operations easily.  Also, it put things out of my
control.  Image viewing programs I tested did not allow multi-file
operations or did not do what I wanted it to.

 So, I got the idea to use the wonderful functionality of Emacs and
`dired' to do it.  It would allow me to do almost anything I wanted,
which is basically just to browse all my pictures in an easy way,
letting me manipulate and tag them in various ways.  `dired' already
provide all the file handling and navigation facilities; I only
needed to add some functions to display the images.

 I briefly tried out thumbs.el, and although it seemed more
powerful than this package, it did not work the way I wanted to.  It
was too slow to created thumbnails of all files in a directory (I
currently keep all my 2000+ images in the same directory) and
browsing the thumbnail buffer was slow too.  image-dired.el will not
create thumbnails until they are needed and the browsing is done
quickly and easily in dired.  I copied a great deal of ideas and
code from there though... :)

 `image-dired' stores the thumbnail files in `image-dired-dir'
using the file name format ORIGNAME.thumb.ORIGEXT.  For example
~/.emacs.d/image-dired/myimage01.thumb.jpg.  The \"database\" is for
now just a plain text file with the following format:

file-name-non-directory;comment:comment-text;tag1;tag2;tag3;...;tagN


PREREQUISITES
=============

* The ImageMagick package.  Currently, `convert' and `mogrify' are
used.  Find it here: http://www.imagemagick.org.

* For non-lossy rotation of JPEG images, the JpegTRAN program is
needed.

* For `image-dired-get-exif-data' and `image-dired-write-exif-data' to work,
the command line tool `exiftool' is needed.  It can be found here:
http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/.  These two functions
are, among other things, used for writing comments to image files
using `image-dired-thumbnail-set-image-description' and to create
\"unique\" file names using `image-dired-get-exif-file-name' (used by
`image-dired-copy-with-exif-file-name').


USAGE
=====

This information has been moved to the manual.  Type `C-h r' to open
the Emacs manual and go to the node Thumbnails by typing `g
Thumbnails RET'.

Quickstart: M-x image-dired RET DIRNAME RET

where DIRNAME is a directory containing image files.

LIMITATIONS
===========

* Supports all image formats that Emacs and convert supports, but
the thumbnails are hard-coded to JPEG format.

* WARNING: The \"database\" format used might be changed so keep a
backup of `image-dired-db-file' when testing new versions.


TODO
====

* Support gallery creation when using per-directory thumbnail
storage.

* Some sort of auto-rotate function based on rotate info in the
EXIF data.

* Check if exiftool exist before trying to call it to give a better
error message.

* Investigate if it is possible to also write the tags to the image
files.

* From thumbs.el: Add an option for clean-up/max-size functionality
  for thumbnail directory.

* From thumbs.el: Add setroot function.

* From thumbs.el: Add image resizing, if useful (image-dired's automatic
 \"image fit\" might be enough)

* From thumbs.el: Add the \"modify\" commands (emboss, negate,
  monochrome etc).

* Asynchronous creation of thumbnails.

* Add `image-dired-display-thumbs-ring' and functions to cycle that.  Find
out which is best, saving old batch just before inserting new, or
saving the current batch in the ring when inserting it.  Adding it
probably needs rewriting `image-dired-display-thumbs' to be more general.

* Find some way of toggling on and off really nice keybindings in
dired (for example, using C-n or <down> instead of C-S-n).  Richard
suggested that we could keep C-t as prefix for image-dired commands
as it is currently not used in dired.  He also suggested that
`dired-next-line' and `dired-previous-line' figure out if
image-dired is enabled in the current buffer and, if it is, call
`image-dired-dired-next-line' and
`image-dired-dired-previous-line', respectively.  Update: This is
partly done; some bindings have now been added to dired.

* Enhanced gallery creation with basic CSS-support and pagination
of tag pages with many pictures.

* Rewrite `image-dired-modify-mark-on-thumb-original-file' to be
less ugly.

* In some way keep track of buffers and windows and stuff so that
it works as the user expects.

* More/better documentation")

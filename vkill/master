M-x vkill creates a buffer containing ps(1) output and allows you to
mvoe around in it marking processes to be sent a signal.  Type a `?'
in the Process Info buffer for more help.

The commands vkill and list-unix-processes are the package entry points.

To autoload, use
    (autoload 'vkill \"vkill\" nil t)
    (autoload 'list-unix-processes \"vkill\" nil t)
in your .emacs file.")

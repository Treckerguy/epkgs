This provides a hookable mechanism by which to have Keywords
headers automatically generated based on word frequency of the
body.  The goal is to make it possible to score on Keywords
provided, of course, that Keywords gets to the overview files.

To make this work, all one need do is...
For generation during posting:
(add-hook 'message-send-hook 'message-keyword-insert)
For generation during received-mail processing:
(add-hook 'nnmail-prepare-incoming-message-hook 'message-auto-keyword-insert)

Keywords get into overviews at the server if it is capable and
configured to do so.  In INN, since 1.5b2, article-supplied
Keywords can be gotten into overviews by enabling the line
\"Keywords:full\" in overview.fmt.

Note as well that INN since 2.0 has been capable of doing server-
side keyword auto-generation, whether or not there are article-
supplied Keywords headers.  (Also available in 1.7, as a patch,
predating the integration of this code for 2.x.)  INN grinds
article bodies on the way through, supplying additional data
to overchan, thereby providing useful bits of article content
for scoring/killing purposes, without requiring full-body searches.

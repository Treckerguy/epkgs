Window-based line number mode, which displays each number of line
at the left window. Be sure that this is *not* a minor mode.
So far, This elisp does not work well under Xemacs...

Installation:

Add this file (byte-compiling it is recommended) to your load-path.
Then add one of these set of lines (or similar ones) to your config:

(require 'wb-line-number)

Type \"M-x wb-line-number-toggle\" to toggle this mode manually.

Optional Setting:

(setq truncate-partial-width-windows nil) ; use continuous line
(set-scroll-bar-mode nil)                 ; no scroll bar, even in x-window system")

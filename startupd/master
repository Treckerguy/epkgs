 :commentary "\
Small utility library that loads all Lisp files located in the
directory indicated by `startupd-path'.  Files are filtered by the
`startupd-file-name-regexp' and the loading order is determined by
the function defined in `startupd-file-loading-sort-function'.  By
default the file loading order is done by using `string<' and
byte-compiled versions always take precedence.

Installation:

Add this to your .emacs:

(add-to-list 'load-path \"/folder/containing/file\")
(require 'startupd)
(startupd-load-files)")

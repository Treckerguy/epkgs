 :commentary "\
The purpose of this package is to provide a default content for
files. It extends the autoinsert package from Charlie Martin and
took the idea of expanding parameters as in auto-template from
Kevin Broadey (as suggested by Cedric Beust). It also allows to
specify the initial position of the dot.

Whenever an unexistent file is visited, its initial content can be
specified by a parameterized template stored in the directory
dc-auto-insert-directory or by explicit evaluation of some
specified forms. A single undo removes all this initialization.

To use it, add to your .emacs (taking care of load-path)
         (require 'defaultcontent)
and it is ready (try to open the empty foobar.el file for example).")

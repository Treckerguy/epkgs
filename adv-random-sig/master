This is an advanced random signature inserter for message-mode
(probably other modes for composing mail and news) and for use with
Gnus' posting styles.

It is heavily based on random-sig.el by Matt Simmons
<simmonmt@acm.org>, http://www.netcom.com/~simmonmt.

Warning: This is the first lisp thing I've ever done since I left
the warm and comfort home of my own .emacs and .gnus.  It may,
well, it _will_ contain awkward lisp statements and errors.  But I
can assure you that it works for my environment and didn't cause
any harm so far.

BUILDING A SIGNATURE
--------------------

A signature is built as follows:

-- 
[head]
random quote

The head is a string, constant to all signatures (F.e. an URL or
your email address).  Point `adv-signature-head' to a file with the
contents of that head.  The use of a signature head is optional,
set `adv-signature-head' to `nil' if you don't want it.

The quote (or whatever) is taken from a randomly chosen file in the
directory specified by `adv-signature-dir'.  Every quote is stored
in a single file, the file name doesn't matter.  To exstinguish all
randomness, you can set `adv-signature-dir' to a file.

Another feature is the insertion of a greeting formula _before_ the
signature seperator.  If you're as lazy as myself, you'll find this
useful.  Put the greeting in a file and point
`adv-signature-greeting' to it.  As `adv-signature-head' this is
optional - set `adv-signature-greeting' to `nil' if you don't need
it.  Note that this doesn't interact well with Gnus' message-mode.
You'll have to manually remove the signature seperator that Gnus
places _before_ the greeting.

Note that you can savely place the greeting formula and the head
within `adv-signature-dir' as they are excludes from the random
choice.

USAGE
-----

Put this file in a directory covered by your load-path and place
the following in your .emacs or .gnus:

(require 'adv-random-sig)

Make the variables point to the apropriate directory resp. files:

(setq adv-signature-dir (expand-file-name \"~/.sigs/quotes/\"))

(setq adv-signature-head nil) ; don't use the head
;(setq adv-signature-head (expand-file-name \"~/.sigs/head/myurl\"))

(setq adv-signature-greeting nil) ; don't use the greeting formula
;(setq adv-signature-greeting (expand-file-name \"~/.sigs/greet/english\"))


There are several functions you can call to mess up your mail or
news posting with signatures, heads and greeting formulas.  Now
it's up to you, to choose the one, that fits your purposes.

FLAVOURS
--------

Important notice: in contrast to the originial random-sig.el you
can influence the decision on what random quote will be used in a
certain manner.  Every user interface function below can have an
optional argument, that constraints the quote to a certain
\"flavour\".  A flavour simply is a subdirectory to
`adv-signature-dir'.  Place quotes of a certain flavour in that
subdirectory and see the example:

~/.sig/quotes/
~/.sig/quotes/linux/
~/.sig/quotes/linux/lin1
~/.sig/quotes/linux/lin2
~/.sig/quotes/humor/
~/.sig/quotes/humor/hum1
~/.sig/quotes/humor/hum2
~/.sig/quotes/quote1

Setting `adv-signature-dir' to \"~/.sig/quotes/\" the flavour \"linux\"
will choose between lin1 and lin2.  If flavour is \"linux/lin2\", the
only choice is lin2.  If the flavour is \"\" or not specified, the
only choice is quote1.  Sorry, the choice is not recursive, anyone
who can do that?

FUNCTIONS
---------

`adv-random-signature-no-sep' returns a random signature without
the usual seperator.  This is meant to be used with Gnus'
message-mode, which is hard to convince _not_ to insert the \"-- \"
line.  If you use posting styles, an example would be:

(setq gnus-posting-styles
  '(
     ((message-news-p)
	 (signature adv-random-signature-no-sep))

     (\"^comp\\\\.os\\\\.linux.*\"
      (signature adv-random-signature-no-sep \"linux\")) 
   [...]

[$ray$ lacks of an example for calling from a hook!]

`adv-random-signature' does the same thing as
`adv-random-signature-no-sep' but adds a signature seperator in
front and makes use of `adv-signature-head' if non nil.

`adv-random-signature-fun' is ment to be a backward compatible
version of `random-signature-fun' in the original random-sig.el.
Note, that the names of the variables compared with random-sig.el
have change too!

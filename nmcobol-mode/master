NMCOBOL -- COmmon Business Oriented Language - in ?TANDEM line format.

This is currently a work-in-progress.  You are welcome to try it and
submit changes or report bugs but there is no point trying to report
lack of features unless you are including patches that address such
shortcomings.

Since Tandem's line format is not standard this mode is not likely to
suit the needs of most Cobol progammers.  Moreover, Tandem Cobol has
extensions that standard Cobol doesn't have and may not implement
features required or generally available by other Cobol compilers.
I'm happy to add submitted patches to support other compilers only if
such patches don't interfere with support of Tandem Cobol.")

This file provides minor modes for putting clickable overlays on
references to bugs.  A bug reference is text like \"PR foo/29292\";
this is mapped to a URL using a user-supplied format.

Two minor modes are provided.  One works on any text in the buffer;
the other operates only on comments and strings.")

Description:

 This package provides the `func-doc' command to interface to Info for
 functions and commands in various modes, as well as command completion.

 The package currently supports Awk, Perl, texinfo and LaTeX but is
 extensible.  If you've got an Info file with a node that list functions,
 than this package can probably interface to it.
 Also makes Meta-[TAB] (aka M-\\t) do typing completion using the keywords
 extracted from the function list.

 In addition, it works in Info files for supported topics.  e.g. in the
 Info file \"gawk\", you may use \"C-c d\" (func-doc) to look-up the page
 about a given command.  This is faster than using the Info index node.

 Installation instructions:

 All you need to do is add this line to your .emacs file:
  (require 'func-doc)
 making the commands `func-doc' and `func-doc-complete' available.

 To make func-doc display the Info buffer in another window, set the
 following variable to `t' in your ~/.emacs file: 
  (setq func-doc-split-window t)

 It is suggested that you make `C-c d' locally bound to func-doc in
 supported modes and M-[tab] bound to `func-doc-complete' (Note that
 auc-tex already provides completion for latex, and you probably don't want
 to override it).  The code to do this is left uncommented below, it's up
 to you to leave it, comment it out, or paste it in your ~/.emacs file.

 You may also use \"C-h d\" by adding this to yor ~/.emacs file:
   (define-key help-map \"d\" 'func-doc)

 For XEmacs, the code below must be loaded *before* you edit a file which
 will use func-doc (except for info which should be loaded before to
 define \"C-c d\", unless you use \"C-h d\" in the help-map).")

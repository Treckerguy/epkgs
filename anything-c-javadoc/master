Some anything configurations for quickly open javadocs.

This package works by scanning the allclasses-frame.html and the index
file(s) (index-all.html or index-files/index-*.html), which are generated
by the javadoc tool, for some information such as the path to their
documentation uri and making ordinary buffers suitable for anything's
candidate-in-buffer capability. Then it dumps each these buffers as a _big
string_ into the cache file for the next Emacs session.

This html-processing stuff is so much iffy, fragile and maybe totally
broken :)

This package will generate cache files unless they exist. The cache
generation processes will take a _long_ while, please hold on for some
time. The cache file generation will be take into account if a). neither
candidates-buffer nor corresponding cache file exit or b). `anything' is
being executed with any prefix-arguments. The location of the cache files
are controlled with the customizable options:
`anything-c-javadoc-classes-cache-filename' and
`anything-c-javadoc-indexes-cache-filename'.

If you want to add more javadocs, add the urls to `anything-c-javadoc-dirs'
then regenerate the cache files with C-u M-x `anything-c-javadoc'. Or
define more anything-sources with `install-anything-c-source-javadoc*'
and (optionally) add newly created sources to `anything-c-javadoc-sources'.

Installation:

Put the anything-c-javadoc.el and anything.el to your load-path and
(optionally) install emacs-w3m package.")

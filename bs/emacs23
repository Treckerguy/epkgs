The bs-package contains a main function bs-show for poping up a
buffer in a way similar to `list-buffers' and `electric-buffer-list':
The new buffer offers a Buffer Selection Menu for manipulating
the buffer list and buffers.

Quick Installation und Customization:

Use
  M-x bs-show
for buffer selection or optional bind a key to main function `bs-show'
  (global-set-key \"\\C-x\\C-b\" 'bs-show)    ;; or another key

For customization use
M-x bs-customize


More Commentary:

bs-show will generate a new buffer named *buffer-selection*, which shows
all buffers or a subset of them, and has possibilities for deleting,
saving and selecting buffers. For more details see docstring of
function `bs-mode'. A current configuration describes which buffers appear
in *buffer-selection*. See docstring of variable `bs-configurations' for
more details.

The package bs combines the advantages of the Emacs functions
`list-buffers' and `electric-buffer-list'.

Additional features for Buffer Selection Menu:
 - configurable list of buffers (show only files etc.).
 - comfortable way to change displayed subset of all buffers.
 - show sorted list of buffers.
 - cyclic navigation:
    - goes to top of buffer list if you are on last line and press down.
    - goes to end of buffer list if you are on first line and press up.
 - Offer an alternative buffer list by prefix key C-u.

Cycling through buffers

This package offers two functions for buffer cycling. If you want to cycle
through buffer list you can use `bs-cycle-next' or `bs-cycle-previous'.
Bind these function to a key like
  (global-set-key [(f9)]   'bs-cycle-previous)
  (global-set-key [(f10)]  'bs-cycle-next)

Both functions use a special subset of all buffers for cycling to avoid
to go through internal buffers like *Messages*.

Cycling through buffers ignores sorting because sorting destroys
the logical buffer list. If buffer list is sorted by size you
won't be able to cycle to the smallest buffer.

Customization:

There is a customization group called `bs' in group `convenience'.
Start customization by M-x bs-customize

Buffer list
-----------
You can define your own configurations by extending variable
`bs-configurations' (see docstring for details).

`bs-default-configuration' contains the name of default configuration.
The default value is \"files\" which means to show only files.

If you always want to see all buffers, customize variable
`bs-default-configuration' in customization group `bs'.

Configure sorting
-----------------
You can define functions for sorting the buffer list.
When selecting buffers, you can step through available sorting
methods with key 'S'.
To define a new way of sorting, customize variable `bs-sort-functions'.

There are four basic functions for sorting:
  by buffer name, by mode, by size, or by filename

Configure buffer cycling
------------------------
When cycling through buffer list the functions for cycling will use
the current configuration of bs to calculate the buffer list.
If you want to use a different configuration for cycling you have to set
the variable `bs-cycle-configuration-name'. You can customize this variable.

For example: If you use the configuration called \"files-and-scratch\" you
can cycle through all file buffers and *scratch* although your current
configuration perhaps is \"files\" which ignores buffer *scratch*.")

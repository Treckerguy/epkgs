The bs-package contains a main function bs-show for poping up a
buffer in a way similar to `list-buffers' and `electric-buffer-list':
The new buffer offers a Buffer Selection Menu for manipulating
the buffer list and buffers.

Quick Installation und Customization:

Use
  M-x bs-show
for buffer selection or optional bind a key to main function `bs-show'
  (global-set-key \"\\C-x\\C-b\" 'bs-show)    ;; or another key

For customization use
M-x bs-customize


More Commentary:

bs-show will generate a new buffer named *buffer-selection*, which shows
all buffers or a subset of them, and has possibilities for deleting,
saving and selecting buffers. For more details see docstring of
function `bs-mode'. A current configuration describes which buffers appear
in *buffer-selection*. See docstring of variable `bs-configurations' for
more details.

The package bs combines the advantages of the Emacs functions
`list-buffers' and `electric-buffer-list'.

Additioal features for Buffer Selection Menu:
 - configurable list of buffers (show only files etc.).
 - comfortable way to change displayed subset of all buffers.
 - show sorted list of buffers.
 - cyclic navigation:
    - goes to top of buffer list if you are on last line and press down.
    - goes to end of buffer list if you are on first line and press up.
 - Offer an alternative buffer list by prefix key C-u.

Cycling through buffers

This package offers two functions for buffer cycling. If you want to cycle
through buffer list you can use `bs-cycle-next' or `bs-cycle-previous'.
Bind these function to a key like
  (global-set-key [(f9)]   'bs-cycle-previous)
  (global-set-key [(f10)]  'bs-cycle-next)

Both functions use a special subset of all buffers for cycling to avoid
to go through internal buffers like *Messages*.

Cycling through buffers ignores sorting because sorting destroys
the logical buffer list. If buffer list is sorted by size you
won't be able to cycle to the smallest buffer.")

 :commentary "\
These are extensions to psgml that I have found useful when working
with XML, SGML, and HTML.  I would be happy to see them
incorporated into psgml.  If not, they are offered for general use.

The difference between `tehom-psgml-add-element-to-element' etc and
`psgml-add-element-to-element' etc is that the new functions let
the caller stipulate values for the various attributes of the added
element, while the old version only allows the user to do that at
runtime.")

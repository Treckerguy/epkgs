Lui is a simple extensible mode that allows any program to present
a userfriendly interface to the user. This interface is closely
oriented on the user interface of ERC.

To use, simply call lui-mode with a function to handle user input
in your mode function. Don't kill all local variables afterwards,
lui-mode does that for you!

Now your function should be called with user input, and you can
call `lui-insert' and `lui-prompt' at will.

That's it.")

 :commentary "\
As the Eternal Holy War of tabs-versus-spaces rages on, even within
individual projects, an emacs minor mode arises from the depths of
github with the goal of easing the burden placed on the programmer
of trying to maintain consistency in text files.

If you jump into a file that uses tabs for indentation, you shall
continue using tabs for indentation. If you jump into a file that
uses spaces for indentation, you shall continue using spaces for
indentation. That's the idea.

Installation:

o For the impatient, here's a quick setup example (after putting
  indent-hints.el in your load path):

`     (require 'indent-hints)
`     (indent-hints-global-mode)

  You should probably at least customize the indent-hints-mode
  group to use your preferred space/tabs setup, like so:

`     M-x customize-group [RET] indent-hints [RET]

o You can set up some \"whitespace profiles\" that get selected
  automatically when a buffer is detected to be tab-loving or
  space-loving. To enable this functionality, you should customize
  the `indent-hints-mode` group and enable
  indent-hints-profile-switching-enabled, or add to your .emacs:

`     (setq indent-hints-profile-switching-enabled t)

o You can also add your own custom functions to the hooks
  `indent-hints-mode-tab-loving-hook` and
  `indent-hints-mode-space-loving-hook` which run after a buffer is
  detected to be tab-loving or space-loving, respectively.")

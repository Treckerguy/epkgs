 :commentary "\
The major mode for editing Jess code. Very similar to CLIPS, which
in turn is a close relative of Lisp. Much of the code was borrowed
from the various Lisp-related modes developed for Emacs.

For interacting with a Jess interpreter see `run-jess' in
the `inf-jess' package.

Please send enhancement requests and bug reports directly to me
<david.young@fnc.fujitsu.com>. If you make a change yourself, or
adapt this program to another environment, I'd appreciate hearing
about it.

To do:
  * Figure out how to get 'font-lock' to recognize the \"=>\" and
    \"<-\" Jess symbols.
  * Figure out how to change the indentation rules for 'else and
    other similar keywords.
  * Add any more key bindings that make sense.
  * Consider defining user-customizable variables with 'defcustom'.

Change log:
 original, 0.5       --  9 August 1999
 patchlevel 1, 0.6   --  23 August 1999
   * Corrected font-lock problem.
   * Added write-file hook for paren-matching support.
 patchlevel 2, 0.7   --  26 August 1999
   * Fixed another font-lock problem; embedded keywords now are no
     longer incorrectly highlighted. Thanks to Kai Grossjohann for
     the solution.
 patchlevel 3, 0.8   -- 17 September 1999
   * New \"Jess\" menubar structure.
   * Minor enhancement to font-lock (added syntax entry so '-' is
     identified as a word constituent).
 patchlevel 4, 1.0   -- 5 January 2000
   * Font-lock code to identify the 'if' keyword. Thanks to Steven
     Tamm here.
 patchlevel 5, 1.1   -- 14 September 2000
   * Additional keyword highlighting corresponding to latest Jess
     releases, including improved handling of (import), (defclass),
     (deftemplate) and (deffacts).")

This is a spot of code for viewing the contents of LHa (ie. LZH)
self-extracting executables from `archive-mode'.  The executable part,
which is meant for DOS, is not executed.

There's no support for modifying such files; it looks like the unix
version of the lha program doesn't have support for writing them (only
reading).

A random .exe file is of course might not be an LHa file, so
`archive-exe-p' and `archive-lzh-exe-mode-maybe' below check the contents
before going to archive-mode.")

* Now I dont have to touch a mouse to fiddle with itunes.
   Handy when you are remotely logged into the machine,
   or using a really large Emacs frame.
     (setq itunes-key [f5]) ;; or some other key.
     (require 'osx-itunes)  ;; this will bind the key.
 * Press the itunes key and then one of:
     key again            : toggle info window.
     +/-/up/down/mute/0-9 : volume control
     left/right           : prev/next track
     space                : toggles playing

 * This was tested on Emacs 21.3, iTunes 4.2 and OSX 10.3
 * This meets my needs, but playlist selection could be added
   as well as fontification")

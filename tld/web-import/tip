tld.el provides a command for looking up TLDs, either by searching for a
specific TLD or by searching country names.

One command is provided: `tld'.

The latest tld.el is always available from:

  <URL:http://www.davep.org/emacs/tld.el>

Note that, to some degree, this code duplicates the functionality
provided by `what-domain' (a command that is part of emacs). tld.el
differs slightly in that it allows for both TLD and country name
searches. Also, compared to emacs 20.7, the list of TLDs is more complete
(yes, I know, I should submit a patch to the emacs maintainers, I will at
some point).

INSTALLATION:

o Drop tld.el somwehere into your `load-path'. Try your site-lisp
  directory for example (you might also want to byte-compile the file).

o Add the following autoload statement to your ~/.emacs file:

  (autoload 'tld \"tld\" \"Perform a TLD lookup\" t)")

This library extends standard library `hl-line.el' in these ways:

 1. As an alternative to turning on `hl-line' highlighting at all
    times, you can turn it on only when Emacs is idle.  To do that,
    use command `toggle-hl-line-when-idle' and customize
    `global-hl-line-mode' to nil.

 2. As another alternative, you can turn it on for only a few
    seconds.  To do that, use command `flash-line-highlight' and
    customize `global-hl-line-mode' to nil.

 3. It provides a face, `hl-line', that you can customize, instead
    of using option `hl-line-face'.  

    I suggested #3 to the Emacs developers, and it has been added
    to Emacs 22, but with a different default value.  If you use
    library `crosshairs.el', you might want to customize this to a
    value similar to what is used there, so that the horizontal and
    vertical highlights will be the same.

 To use this library, put this in your Emacs init file (~/.emacs):

   (require 'hl-line+) ; Load this file (it will load `hl-line.el')

 To turn on `global-hl-line-mode' only when Emacs is idle, by
 default, add this line also to your init file:

   (toggle-hl-line-when-idle 1) ; Highlight only when idle

 You can use command `toggle-hl-line-when-idle' to turn idle
 highlighting on and off at any time.  You can use command
 `hl-line-when-idle-interval' to change the number of idle seconds
 to wait before highlighting.


 See also these libraries:

 * `col-highlight.el', which highlights the current column.

 * `crosshairs.el', which highlights the current line and the
   current column, at the same time.  It requires libraries
   `col-highlight.el' and `hl-line+.el'.

 * `hl-spotlight.el', which extends `hl-line.el' by spotlighting
   the lines around the cursor.

 * `cursor-chg.el' or library `oneonone.el', to change the cursor
   type when Emacs is idle.

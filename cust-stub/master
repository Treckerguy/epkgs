 :commentary "\
Emacs 19.34 and earlier, and XEmacs 19.14 and earlier, do not have the
`defcustom' or `defgroup' forms used for user option customization.
As of May 1997, many of my own programs use these forms, so I am
including a stub to provide backward-compatibility in earlier versions
of emacs.")

This is an add-on library for project-buffer-mode.

iproject stands for Interactive Project; based on the
project-buffer-mode; it provides an interactive way to create
projects.

Simply creates a new project using `iproject-new' (C-x p n); then
add new projects using `iproject-add-project' (C-c n).

Once the project is created it is possible to add extra files to
the current project using `iproject-add-files-to-current-project'
(C-c +).

iproject will ask the user for command lines (with default values
based on the selected project type) to run each user action which
are: build/clean/run/debug and update.  These command lines will be
stored in the project but also saved with the project.

HOW TO INSTALL IT:

Just add to your .emacs:
  (require 'iproject)
  (iproject-key-binding)

KEY BINDINGS IN THE IPROJECT BUFFER:

C-c n   to add new project
C-c +   to add file to an existing project
C-c C-r to revert the project
C-x C-w to write the project
C-x C-s to save the project

as well as all standard project-buffer-mode key-bindings.

These simple functions  let you add  log entries for files you edit
as soon as you want and then insert your log entries in the comment
buffer  when you commit your  changes via the version control tools
(vc or cvs).

The entries are  stored in files with a  .flog extension. ie. for a
file called  foo.bar the entries  will be in foo.bar.flog. When the
commit is done the corresponding files are deleted.

To install add this line to your .emacs or to the
site-start.el file :

(require 'file-log)

You can bind the command using the following declarations for example :

(define-key ctl-x-map \"l\" 'flog-add-entry)
(define-key ctl-x-4-map \"l\" 'flog-add-entry-other-window)
(define-key ctl-x-5-map \"l\" 'flog-add-entry-other-frame)

and to add an entry in the Tools menu :

(define-key menu-bar-tools-menu [separator-print]
  '(\"--\"))
(define-key menu-bar-tools-menu [flog-add-entry]
 '(\"Add file log entry\" . flog-add-entry))

To insert an entry use the following functions :
	o flog-add-entry [C-x l]
	o flog-add-entry-other-window [C-x 4 l]
	o flog-add-entry-other-frame [C-x 5 l]

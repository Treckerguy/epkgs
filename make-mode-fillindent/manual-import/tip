This is a spot of code for makefile-mode to let fill-paragraph (M-q) work
on indented comments like

	foo:
		# this is
		# some comment
		echo hi

In Emacs 22 and 21 makefile-mode uses a special makefile-fill-paragraph
for filling.  It handles \"#\" comments at the start of a line, but does
nothing if they're indented.  Doing nothing is particularly disconcerting
if you use filladapt.el, because filladapt-debug shows a correct
prefix+paragraph analysis yet M-q has no effect.

Whether or not writing indented comments in a makefile is a good idea is
another question of course.  \"make\" runs them with the shell, which will
ignore them.  The happy side-effect is to get an echo from make, so you
see them as the rule runs (whereas unindented makefile comments are
consumed by make).

Paragraph identification in Emacs 21 and XEmacs 21 makefile-mode isn't
really setup for indented comments, and no attempt is made here to do
anything about that.  The suggestion is to use filladapt which gets it
right (or is easier to configure if it doesn't).")

Description:

This package provides two functions `aux-renumber-single' and
`aux-renumber-multi' to renumber equation labels and references
in LaTeX documents so that they match their representation in
the \".aux\" file(s) and the formatted document.

Why would you want to do that?  Well, consider a manuscript of
a book containing several hundreds of equations spread across
a dozen or more files.  Since it is impossible to give reasonable
names to so many equations, they may have been given some ad-hoc
labels when the manuscript was typed.  After completing some
intermediate or final version that will be printed and possibly
distributed, it may be convenient to renumber the labels so that
you can directly refer to the equation numbers in the printed
version without having to figure out what cryptic label to type
to produce the desired equation number in subsequent edits.

Another appilcation might be a manuscript of a paper that will
be submitted electronically to a journal.  To avoid confusion
in subsequent correspondence with the journal editor, it might
be advantageous if the labels match their representation in the
paper copy submitted to the publisher.


Usage:

1. Load or autoload this file:

   (load-library \"aux-renum\")

or
   (autoload 'aux-renumber-single \"aux-renum\"
     \"Renumber labels in a single-file LaTeX document.\" t)
   (autoload 'aux-renumber-multi \"aux-renum\"
     \"Renumber labels in a multi-file LaTeX document.\" t)

2. Run it interactively:

  M-x aux-renumber-single
  M-x aux-renumber-multi")

`perkymbf' makes your Emacs use a dedicated minibuffer frame that becomes
visually highlighted whenever it is prompting for input.  The author finds
this helpful on a large X display.

`perkymbf' was developed under FSF Emacs 20.7 on a GNU/Linux system, and has
also tested successfully under FSF Emacs 21.2.  (Unfortunately, the Emacs21
fringe is *not* colored `perkymbf-active-background-color' when prompting.)
`perkymbf' has not been tested on non-Un*xish systems, nor with XEmacs.

To install `perkymbf', put this file somewhere in your load path, add the
following line to your `~/.emacs' file, restart Emacs, and optionally
customize any features you like under Environment->Perkymbf.

    (when window-system (require 'perkymbf))

If you wish to set `default-frame-alist' or `minibuffer-frame-alist' in
your `~/.emacs', you should do it before loading `perkymbf', like so:

    (when window-system
      (setq minibuffer-frame-alist
            '((width                 . 181)
              (height                . 1)
              (left                  . (+ 2))
              (top                   . (- 6))
              (title                 . \"Emacs Minibuffer\")
              (internal-border-width . 4)))
      (require 'perkymbf))

If you later find that you have some funky package that is pretending to
read from the minibuffer, but the minibuffer frame isn't becoming
highlighted, add something like the following to your `~/.emacs' file (in
this example, `funky-password-reader' is the name of the function that is
pretending to read from the minibuffer).

    (perkymbf-defadvice-echoprompter funky-password-reader)

Now that you have a perky minibuffer frame, you might wish to have your X
window manager do special handling of it.  The X window class of the
minibuffer frame is `Emacs', and the X window name is `minibuffer'.  For
example, if you use Larswm, your `.larswmrc' will probably have a line
something like:

    larswm.toolclass.0: Emacs~minibuffer

The exact window manager configuration is left as an exercise for the
reader.")

Summary: how to use the updating commands

The node and menu updating functions automatically

  * insert missing `@node' lines,
  * insert the `Next', `Previous' and `Up' pointers of a node,
  * insert or update the menu for a section,
  * create a master menu for a Texinfo source file.

With a prefix argument, the `texinfo-update-node' and
`texinfo-make-menu' functions do their jobs in the region.

In brief, the functions for creating or updating nodes and menus, are:

    texinfo-update-node (&optional beginning end)
    texinfo-every-node-update ()
    texinfo-sequential-node-update (&optional region-p)

    texinfo-make-menu (&optional beginning end)
    texinfo-all-menus-update ()
    texinfo-master-menu ()

    texinfo-insert-node-lines  (&optional title-p)

    texinfo-indent-menu-description (column &optional region-p)

The `texinfo-column-for-description' variable specifies the column to
which menu descriptions are indented.

Texinfo file structure
----------------------

To use the updating commands, you must structure your Texinfo file
hierarchically.  Each `@node' line, with the exception of the top
node, must be accompanied by some kind of section line, such as an
`@chapter' or `@section' line.  Each node-line/section-line
combination must look like this:

     @node    Lists and Tables, Cross References, Structuring, Top
     @comment node-name,        next,             previous,    up
     @chapter Making Lists and Tables

or like this (without the `@comment' line):

     @node    Lists and Tables, Cross References, Structuring, Top
     @chapter Making Lists and Tables

If the file has a `top' node, it must be called `top' or `Top' and
be the first node in the file.")

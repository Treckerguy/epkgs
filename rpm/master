This mode provides sort of a  dired buffer to interact with the rpm
utility used on some GNU/Linux systems to manage software packages.
The mode starts  up by displaying all installed  packages.  You can
then  get  detailed informations  on  a  specific package,  verify,
install/uninstall  a package  or check/list  dependencies.   In the
detailed information buffer you  can easily visit listed files e.g.
to  check readme's or  other documentation  stuff.  rpm  also hooks
into  dired mode, so  you can  directly install  a file  (or tagged
files) from a dired buffer.

It's  generally a nice way to  browse  through the packages without
having to remember the syntax of rpm ;)

Installation:

In order to  use this package, you need   Elib, the GNU Emacs  lisp
library (I  use version 1.0). You  can get the latest  version from
`ftp.lysator.liu.se' in  `pub/emacs'  with anonymous ftp.   Be sure
that  the files  of the Elib  package  are in your  `load-path'. If
you're not sure whether you've got  the package already try `locate
cookie.elc' (or something like `find / -name cookie.elc -print').

To use  the rpm-mode  put the source-file  (or better  the compiled
version)  somewhere  where  it  can  be found  (i.e.  somewhere  in
`load-path') and  include the  following expression in  your .emacs
file (or wherever...)

(autoload 'rpm \"rpm\"
     \"Shell for the rpm package management utility.\" t)
(autoload 'rpm-dired-install \"rpm\"
     \"Install all marked (or next ARG) rpm-files.\" t)
(add-hook 'dired-load-hook
       '(lambda () (define-key dired-mode-map \"I\"
                     'rpm-dired-install)))

You can  then start it  up by `M-x rpm'.   `describe-mode' (usually
bound to  C-h m) gives you  help on the  other available functions.
The second and  the third form define `I'  in dired-mode to install
the tagged files or the file on the current line.

If you  have a  display capable of  color you might  enjoy enabling
font-lock-mode to get  colored marks. This will also  work if hl319
was loaded before rpm.

As this  package is mostly  a (hopefully comfortable)  interface to
\"rpm\"  you should  consult the  rpm documentation  about  the exact
functionality  of  the individual  commands  (especially about  the
exact functionality  of the  command-line switches).  This  said, I
can assure  you that most  of the commands  work just as  one would
expect them to..

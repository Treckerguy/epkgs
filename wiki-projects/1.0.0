This package is an optional extension to wiki.el.

This used to be wiki-priv.el -- a package to maintain a public and a
private wiki.  This has now changed.  The public and the private wiki
are still the two default projects, but it is now very easy to add
more wiki projects.  A wiki project is a set of directories
containing pages and a set of publishing rules.

The default setup includes a public and a private project.  The
public project uses the ~/Wiki directory and publishes HTML files
into the ~/WebWiki directory.  The private project uses the ~/Wiki
and the ~/Notes directories and it disables publishing.

Use `wiki-project' to switch projects.  Customize `wiki-projects' to
set them up.  If you do not customize this variable, the \"Public\"
project will take the default values from the variables
`wiki-pub-directory', `wiki-directories' and `wiki-pub-rules'.  Once
you customize `wiki-projects', switching to a project will overwrite
any values stored in those three variables.

In order to install, put (require 'wiki-projects) somewhere in your
~/.emacs file.")

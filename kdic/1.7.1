Use M-x kdic to start a multiple choice practice session.  The data
is derived from a dictionary.  The dictionary is not included.  You
will have to get it yourself.  Any file in the kanjidic or edict
file format will do.

In debian, use \"apt-get install kanjidic\" for a large dictionary of
Japanese kanji including a document explaining the format of the
dictionary file.  Set `kdic-dictionary' and
`kdic-encoding'accordingly.

Inspired by kdrill, a drill program for kanji chars under X writte by
Philip Brown <phil@bolthole.com>.  The kdrill homepage can be found
here: http://www.bolthole.com/kdrill/.

Installation: Copy kdic.el into a directory on your load-path, and
add the following line to your ~/.emacs file:
(autoload 'kdic \"kdic\" \"Practice kanji and vocabulary.\" t)

You can select subsets of the `kdic-dictionary' by customizing the
variables `kdic-filter' and `kdic-index-regexp'.  Here are two
examples of how to set it up.  First use M-x custom-group RET kdic
RET to customize the appropriate group, and then set the variables
as suggested:

Example 1:

Set kdic-index-regexp to \"Jouyou grade level\" and set kdic-filter
to \"Distinct values\" and choose the value \"1\".  This will drill you
on the 80 easiest kanji -- the ones having a jouyou grade level of
1.

Example 2:

Set kdic-index-regexp to \"Spahn & Hadamitzky index\" and set
kdic-filter to \"Grouping\", using sorting function
\"kdic-index-sort\", group size 50, and group number 1.  This will
drill you on the first 50 kanji from the Spahn & Hadamitzky index
(which happens to be the book I use).

When you are happy with the selection, set `kdic-cache' to a
filename to use as a cache.  This makes parsing and filtering of
the original dictionary unnecessary, speeding things up when
starting.  Just delete the file when you want to use another
dictionary, or when you change the filter.

Advanced usage:

Filtering wizard: `kdic-word-filter' is a wizard that will help you
combine two dictionaries.  This allows you to sort the kanji in the
kanjidic file as described above, and then sort the entries in the
edict file according to the kanji with the highest number.  Thus
you can produce a list of words to learn that only require the
simplest kanji!  Example:

Sort the kanji in the kanjidic file according to the \"Jouyou grade
level\", and choose group number 1 of size 100.  This will sort the
edict files such that words with only Jouyou grade level 1 come
first.  From these, the first 100 words will be used.

Flashcard export:

Flashcard.el by Jorgen Schaefer offers a doctor interface instead
of a multiple choice test.  You can export the current vocabulary
into a flashcard file using `kdic-to-flashcard'.

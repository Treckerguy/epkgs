This file was written with emacs using Jamie Lokier's folding mode
That's what the funny ;;{{{ ;;}}} marks are there for

{{{ INSTALLATION:

To install, just drop this file into a directory on your load-path (and
byte-compile it).  To set up Emacs to automatically edit files ending in
\".lua\" using lua-mode add the following to your ~/.emacs file (GNU
Emacs) or ~/.xemacs/init.el file (XEmacs):
   (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '(\"\\\\.lua$\" . lua-mode) auto-mode-alist))
   (autoload 'lua-mode \"lua-mode\" \"Lua editing mode.\" t)

}}}
{{{ Usage

Lua-mode supports c-mode style formatting and sending of
lines/regions/files to a Lua interpreter. An interpreter (see
variable `lua-default-application') will be started if you try to
send some code and none is running. You can use the process-buffer
(named after the application you chose) as if it were an
interactive shell. See the documentation for `comint.el' for
details.

{{{ Key-bindings

To see all the keybindings for Lua mode, look at `lua-setup-keymap'
or start `lua-mode' and type `\\C-h m'.
The keybindings may seem strange, since I prefer to use them with
lua-prefix-key set to nil, but since those keybindings are already used
the default for `lua-prefix-key' is `\\C-c', which is the conventional
prefix for major-mode commands.

You can customise the keybindings either by setting `lua-prefix-key'
or by putting the following in your .emacs
     (setq lua-mode-map (make-sparse-keymap))
and
     (define-key lua-mode-map <your-key> <function>)
for all the functions you need.

Exports BBDB phone entries to a contacts file that can be used by
gnokii to write them to a Nokia mobile phone.

No responsibility for blowing up your phone... blah, blah, blah...
I recommend dumping your phone book to a file (using xgnokii, say)
and keeping it in a safe place until you are sure that
bbdb-gnokii.el doesn't do anything stupid.

The latest version of this file is available via:

  http://meltin.net/hacks/emacs/

The gnokii web site is

  http://www.gnokii.org/

bbdb-gnokii.el is loosely based on JWZ's bbdb-pilot-jwz.el.

gnokii expects a file with the following format:

   name;number;memory_type;entry_location;caller_group_number;\\
   subentry_type;subentry_number_type;subentry_id;subentry_text

The length and syntax of \"name\" and \"number\" are limited, so some
munging goes on.  You can adjust the munging to your needs by
customizing the variables `bbdb-gnokii-firstname-transform',
`bbdb-gnokii-lastname-transform' and
`bbdb-gnokii-location-transform'.

The default settings of these variables reflect Martin's preferences.
Here is a combination of alternative settings used by Reiner:

  (setq
   ;; Use long firstnames and lastnames and a short location:
   bbdb-gnokii-firstname-transform 'bbdb-gnokii-transform-word
   bbdb-gnokii-lastname-transform  12
   bbdb-gnokii-location-transform  'bbdb-gnokii-transform-location
   bbdb-gnokii-max-name-length     16)

The memory_type specifies where to write the contacts (phone memory
or SIM card).  See variable `bbdb-gnokii-default-memory-type' and
it's documentation for details.

Configuration:

Add this to your ~/.emacs or equivalent:

  (autoload
    'bbdb-gnokii-export
    \"bbdb-gnokii\"
    \"Export phone entries from BBDB to a Gnokii contacts file.\"
    t)

If you want to add some standard entries to your phone, you can put
them in a file and set the following variable:

  (setq bbdb-gnokii-extras-file
        (expand-file-name \"~/.bbdb-gnokii-extras.txt\"))

The contents of the specified file get appended to the file
generated from the BBDB (cf. `bbdb-gnokii-extras-file-position').
My phone vendor preloads a bunch of their numbers into the SIM
card, and I'm keeping them until I'm sure they're not useful!

Entries are only extracted from the BBDB for entries that have a
gnokii field.  In general, if this field is present, then all of
the phone numbers (except those that have locations listed in
`bbdb-gnokii-exclude-locations') will be exported.

For example:

  Fred Smith - Widget, Inc.
        mobile: (04) 1234 5678
          home: (02) 1234 5678
        gnokii: t

will have 2 items exported:

Fred S mobile;0412345678;...
Fred S home;0212345678;...

For entries with a name, the default generated name is the first
word of firstname, space, first letter of lastname.

For entries without a name, but with a company, the default
generated name is the first word of the company name.

The phone number locations are only appended if there is more than
1 phone entry exported.

If the gnokii field contains a string in double-quotes, then it
will be used as the name.

If the gnokii field contains something like location=X then the
number for location will be put into speed-dial location X.  All
other entries are put between `bbdb-gnokii-general-min-location'
and `bbdb-gnokii-general-max-location'.

If the gnokii field contains something like (Y) then the entry will
belong to caller group Y, otherwise
`bbdb-gnokii-default-caller-group' is used.

So,

  Fred Smith - Widget, Inc.
        mobile: (04) 1234 5678
          home: (02) 1234 5678
           fax: (02) 8765 4321
        gnokii: \"Freddy\" (0) mobile=2 home=3

will have 2 items exported:

Freddy mobile;0412345678;...;0;
Freddy home;0212345678;...;0;

No item is exported for the fax number because it is a member of
`bbdb-gnokii-exclude-locations'.

If the gnokii field contains \"skip=foo\", the phone number corresponding to
the location \"foo\" will not be exported.

You can also export a whole BBDB record to a single gnokii entry by
setting `bbdb-gnokii-phonebook-style' to `multi' or `mega'.  In
this style the default phone number can be set by specifying the
associated location in the BBDB gnokii field.  For example, if the
gnokii field contains \"[work]\" then the phone number with location
\"work\" will be the default one.  If no default location is
specified in the gnokii field, then the order of preference is
determined by `bbdb-gnokii-preferred-phone-locations'.  If
`bbdb-gnokii-phonebook-style' is set to `mega', an email address
and postal address are also added to the gnokii entry, when
available.

See the variables and code below for more details.  You may check all
customizable variables using `M-x customize-group RET bbdb-gnokii RET'.")

Installation:

Put this file in a folder where Emacs can find it.  On GNU/Linux
it's usually /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/ and on Windows it's
something like \"C:\\Program Files\\Emacs<version>\\site-lisp\".  To
make it run slightly faster you can also compile it from Emacs (M-x
`emacs-lisp-byte-compile'). Then put the following into your .emacs
initialization file (_emacs on Windows):

 (show-paren-mode 1)
 (require 'paren-glint)
 (paren-glint-mode 1)

It will first highlight according to `show-paren-mode' and then
unhighlight after `paren-glint-timeout' seconds.

Bugs:

On some (rare) occations the unhighlighting does not work for some
unknown reason. If point is moved back and forth it works again.")

 :commentary "\
The package provides the ability to keep a labbook. It is based on
(and uses) the \"ChangeLog\" features of emacs, but differs in that
it keeps all of its log messages in one place. From a specifiable
root directory it creates a file per month in a directory per
year. It derives its format from the ChangeLog format except that
the heading is not necessarily the name of a file. 

Bugs

1) The completing read buisness does not happen if current buffer is
not file associated which it a bit of a pain. There are a couple of
obvious hacks around this. (Change to a file name buffer, and have
completing read kill this as a suggestion!

ToDo

1) Should define derived mode for these change logs, so that I can
use a slightly different keymap. Would be nice to have functions
for moving backwards for a period of time in menu items for
instance
2) Linkage to calendar mode perhaps?

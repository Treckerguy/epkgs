 :commentary "\
Start with M-x anything, narrow the list by typing some pattern,
select with up/down/pgup/pgdown/C-p/C-n/C-v/M-v, choose with enter,
left/right moves between sources. With TAB actions can be selected
if the selected candidate has more than one possible action.

Note that anything.el provides only the framework and some example
configurations for demonstration purposes. See anything-config.el
for practical, polished, easy to use configurations which can be
used to assemble a custom personalized configuration. And many
other configurations are in the EmacsWiki.

Maintainer's configuration is in the EmacsWiki. It would tell you
many tips to write smart sources!

Here is Japanese translation of `anything-sources' attributes. Thanks.

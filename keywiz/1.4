 :commentary "\
keywiz.el drills you about Emacs key-bindings.  You're presented
with the name of a command and the docstring, and then prompted for
the correct key sequence.  You'll earn one point for each correct
answer during the time limit.

Invoke with `M-x keywiz'.  A prefix argument will force keywiz to
rescan the key-binding -- this is useful if you want to include
bindings from a different mode.

Are you a true Emacs key-binding wizard or just a poor vi looser?
Get your foot-pedals in position and see how many key-bindings you
can remember in two minutes.

Forget about your Nethack high-score -- surely, knowing how to
wield the powers of the One True Editor at your fingertips will
earn you more bragging rights than ascending bare-footed in some
silly game with vi-keybindings :-)")

Package to control command line CD players.

Just run the cdi-start command, which will pop up a *cdi* buffer
with the status of the CD (eg Playing) and track/artist
information. Various functions are bound to keys in the *cdi*
buffer, eg \">\" is bound to cdi-next-track -- use ? or C-h b to find
all the bindings.")

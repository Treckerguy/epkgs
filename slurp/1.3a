slurp.el is a handly tool used to search a file hierarchy for files with
names that match a regular expression. Slurp will load those files into
emacs buffers for you.

Keep setf properly resolved as a macro instead of accidententally compiled
as a function call.  (Thanks to Phillip Hudson for pointing this out)")

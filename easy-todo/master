`easy-todo-mode' is a very easy todo manager. It simply adds some
highlighted keywords, some special prefix flags(for indicating
different status of todo items) upon `text-mode'.

It supports four different prefix flags, namely, \"^> \"(ongoing),
\"^- \"(todo), \"^| \"(unfinished), \"^o \"(done). Here's a screenshot:

,----
| > (work) Check compress() function
| - (easy-todo) Sort by catagory/tag?
| | (emms) share music with iTunes user?
| o (misc) take a cup of tea
`----

Put this file into your load-path and the following into your
~/.emacs:
          (autoload 'easy-todo-mode \"easy-todo\")")

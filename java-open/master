Purpose
-------
java-open adds the ability to open the source file corresponding to a 
Java class by placing the cursor on the class name and pressing a key.
No TAGS file or other form of preprocessing is needed.

Usage
-----
Example of lines to be added to your .emacs:

    (require 'java-open)

    ; java-open-source-path is similar in function to CLASSPATH
    (setq java-open-source-path '(\"L:/myprog/source\" \"M:/jdk1.3/src\"))

    ; keyboard shortcuts
    (global-set-key [f10] 'java-open-class-at-point)
    (global-set-key [f11] 'java-open-base-class-source)

How it works
------------
This code works by searching the current buffer for an import declaration
corresponding to the class name.  If an import declaration is found then
the filename and relative path is deduced from the import declaration.
Then the directories specified in the java-open-source-path are searched
for the relative path and file, and the file opened if found.

If no import declaration is found then the current directory is searched
before reporting an error.

Limitations
-----------
java-open can only open source files if you point to a class name.  It
cannot look for a class that contains the method name under the cursor.")

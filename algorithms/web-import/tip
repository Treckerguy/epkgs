This is a listing of the algorithms that are implemented by this
file.  Helper functions are not listed here.  All algorithms have a
consistency check with sample data.

All Pairs (using Floyd-Warshall algorithm)
function: all-pairs
status: finished

Transitive Closure
function: transitive-closure
status: finished

Shortest path weights (using Dijkstra's Algorithm)
function: dijkstra
status: finished

Depth-First Search
function: dfs
status: finished

Stronly-Connected Components (using Kosaraju's Algorithm)
function: strongly-connected-components
status: not completely finished -- returns PREV from last DFS
        rather than connected components")

Overview
========
This library makes the grepped lines *grep* buffer, which is made
by command  `M-x grep', editable and write them back to original
files.


INSTALLING
==========
To install this library, save this file to a directory in your
`load-path' (you can view the current `load-path' using \"C-h v
load-path RET\" within Emacs), then add the following line to your
.emacs startup file:

   (require 'ya-grep-edit)


USING
=====
To start edit and write back grepped lines, follow the instructions
described below.

  1. Start grep command by `M-x grep'.
     The grepped lines appears in *grep* buffer.

     You can switch indication-style of the path in each line
     from three kinds of methods:

       1: Show Directory
       2: Show Directory But Common Prefix
       3: Hide Directory

     by selecting sub-menu from `Grep > Ya Grep Edit > View,
     or typing `C-c 1', `C-c 2' or `C-c 3'.

  2. Select *grep* buffer then type `C-c C-e', or select menu
     `Grep > Ya Grep Edit > Edit > Start Edit'.
     This makes grepped lines editable.

  3. Edit grepped lines as you like.
     If you want to cancel editing on a line, put cursor on the line
     then type `C-c C-r', or select menu `Grep > Ya Grep Edit > Edit >
     Revert Line'.

  4. To write back changes to files, type `C-c C-c', or select menu 
     `Grep > Ya Grep Edit > Edit > Save Changes' in *grep* buffer,
     then type `yes' to a prompt.

  `M-x customize-group RET ya-grep-edit RET'


KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============
- This library relies on information provided by font-lock to
  parse the contents of *grep* buffer, so it may not work
  when `font-lock-mode' is off.


WISH LIST
=========
- Implement user option `yage/auto-save-before-save-changes'.")

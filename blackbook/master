 :commentary "\
Although the format of the mailrc file (that Emacs packages use to
read mail aliases from) is very simple, the question \"How do I add
an alias to Emacs?\" has popped up one time too many on comp.emacs.

Blackbook package will parse the `~/.mailrc' file, and present the
aliases in a user-friendly way, using the facilities provided by
the widget library written by Per Abrahamsen.  In a way, this is
similar to Pine's and Netscape's `addressbook' features, hence the
name.")

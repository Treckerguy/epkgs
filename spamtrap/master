This code is intended to be run when a message is being sent.  It will
check if any receiver host is a spam trap (by matching `spam-trap-regexp'
against the hostname, do a DNS lookup if it is, and ask the user for
the real hostname if the host doesn't exist.
Should be put into `message-send-mail-hook'")

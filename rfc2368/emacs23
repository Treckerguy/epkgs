notes:

  -repeat after me: \"the colon is not part of the header name...\"
  -if w3 becomes part of emacs, then it may make sense to have this
   file depend on w3 -- the maintainer of w3 says merging w/ Emacs
   is planned!

historical note:

  this is intended as a replacement for mailto.el

acknowledgements:

  the functions that deal w/ unhexifying in this file were basically
taken from w3 -- i hope to replace them w/ something else soon OR
perhaps if w3 becomes a part of emacs soon, use the functions from w3.")

 :commentary "\
drag-stuff is a minor mode for dragging stuff around in Emacs. You
can drag lines, words and region.

To use drag-stuff, make sure that this file is in Emacs load-path
(add-to-list 'load-path \"/path/to/directory/or/file\")

Then require drag-stuff
(require 'drag-stuff)

To start drag-stuff
(drag-stuff-mode t) or M-x drag-stuff-mode

drag-stuff is buffer local, so hook it up.
(add-hook 'find-file-hook 'drag-stuff-mode)")

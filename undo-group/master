 :commentary "\
* Undo a group of changes at a time.
* You explicitly set the group mark.
* Make your undo-limit and undo-strong-limit really big!

An undo boundary is marked with a single nil (nil). A
undo group boundary is marked with a double nil (nil
nil).  This choice means the present undo code does not
have to be changed and you can undo though groups with a
pause at the group boundary.  This also relies upon the
fact that the function undo-boundary will not add a
boundary if one is already there.

Presently, if invoked without a group boundary it will
undo to the beginning.")

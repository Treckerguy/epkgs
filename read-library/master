 :commentary "\
The function `read-library' reads a loadable library name from the
minibuffer with completion.  Because it may take a long time to
search all of `load-path' to find the loadable libraries, the list is
cached and is only refreshed when `load-path' changes.  Note that
this means that newly added files on a directory on `load-path' won't
be noticed.

The function `read-library-load' has the same interface and
functionality as `load-library' except that it reads with completion.")

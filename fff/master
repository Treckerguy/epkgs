This package provides several shortcut commands for visiting or
inserting files without having to specify them by their complete name.
For example, you can visit programs in your exec-path (some of which may
be humanly-readable shell scripts or config files), or anything else
which is quickly locatable via a prebuilt database or path list.
Completion is also available for many commands.

Using a prefix arg will display a menu of all possible matches,
and you can select one of them by moving point and pressing return.

There are also documented subroutines for common searching operations
and basic interactive behavior to minimize any effort required to add
additional shortcut commands.

To use this package, put the following in your .emacs:

  (autoload 'fff-find-file-in-envvar-path                    \"fff\" nil t)
  (autoload 'fff-insert-file-in-envvar-path                  \"fff\" nil t)
  (autoload 'fff-find-file-in-exec-path                      \"fff\" nil t)
  (autoload 'fff-insert-file-in-exec-path                    \"fff\" nil t)
  (autoload 'fff-find-file-in-path                           \"fff\" nil t)
  (autoload 'fff-insert-file-in-path                         \"fff\" nil t)
  (autoload 'fff-find-file-in-locate-db                      \"fff\" nil t)
  (autoload 'fff-insert-file-in-locate-db                    \"fff\" nil t)

The command `fff-install-map' will bind these commands to a common
prefix of \"C-c C-f\" (you can change this).  To find a list of them, run
that command and then type \"C-c C-f C-h\".

If you are using Emacs 19 or later, you can have this happen
automatically by putting the following in your .emacs:

    (eval-after-load \"fff\" '(fff-install-map))

This package is most useful if you have an up-to-date `locate' database
(built by the `updatedb' program from the GNU findutils), since that
provides a fast way to search for files by name all over the system.
Red Hat 5.0 and later update this database automatically.

I wrote this package I got sick of typing long file names for things way
down in source trees, or having to go look for them first because I
didn't even know where they were.

     The major difference seems to be how it works by layering on top of
     the normal find-file, insert-file, etc. commands.  Its primitives
     for constructing new caches or search paths are different.")

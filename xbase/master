xbase.el provides a mode for editing Xbase source code. xbase.el mostly
supports programs written for CA-Clipper and Clipper compatible compilers
(for example, harbour <URL:http://www.harbour-project.org/>) although,
where possible, support for other Xbase dialects will be added.

You can always find the latest version of xbase.el at:

<URL:http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/xbasemode/xbasemode/xbase.el?rev=HEAD>")

 :commentary "\
This package provides a common interface to query directory servers using
   different protocols such as LDAP, CCSO PH/QI or BBDB.  Queries can be
   made through an interactive form or inline. Inline query strings in
   buffers are expanded with appropriately formatted query results
   (especially used to expand email addresses in message buffers).  EUDC
   also interfaces with the BBDB package to let you register query results
   into your own BBDB database.")

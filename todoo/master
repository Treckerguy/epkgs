 :commentary "\
todoo.el is a mode for editing TODO files in an outline-mode fashion. 
 It has similarities to Oliver Seidel's todo-mode.el , but todoo.el
 has  been significantly simplified to better adhere to mine and
 other users' needs at the time. 

Installation example (~/.emacs):

(autoload 'todoo \"todoo\" \"TODO Mode\" t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"TODO$\" . todoo-mode))

To show your personal todo-list:
M-x todoo

To be prompted a filename, supply any prefix to 'todoo':
C-u M-x todoo

For information on keybindings:
C-h f todoo-mode RET

Customize your todoo with:
M-x customize-group RET  todoo RET

Thanks to Kai Grossjohann for immediate feedback on the first
version, eventually leading to this more fit-for-human-consumption version.")

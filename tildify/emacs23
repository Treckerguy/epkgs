 :commentary "\
This package can be typically used for adding forgotten tildes in TeX
sources or adding `&nbsp;' sequences in SGML (e.g. HTML) texts.

For example, the Czech orthography requires avoiding one letter
prepositions at line endings.  So they should be connected with the
following words by a tilde.  Some users forget to do this all the
time.  The purpose of this program is to check the text and suggest
adding of missing tildes on some places.  It works in a similar
manner to `query-replace-regexp'.

The functionality of this program is actually performing query
replace on certain regions, but for historical reasons explained
above it is called `tildify'.

The default variable settings are suited for Czech, so do not try to
understand them if you are not familiar with Czech grammar and spelling.

The algorithm was inspired by Petr Olšák's program `vlna'.  Abilities of
`tildify.el' are a little limited; if you have improvement suggestions, let
me know.")

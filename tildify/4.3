 :commentary "\
This package can be typically used for adding forgotten tildes in TeX
sources or adding `&nbsp;' sequences in SGML (e.g. HTML) texts.

For example, the Czech ortography requires to avoid one letter prepositions
at line endings.  So they should be connected with following words by tilde.
Some users forget to do this all the time.  Purpose of this program is to
check the text and suggest adding of missing tildes on some places.  It
works in similar manner like `query-replace-regexp'.

Functionality of this program is actually performing query replace on
certain regions.  But from historical reasons explained above it is called
`tildify'.

The algorithm was inspired by Petr Ol¹ák's program `vlna'.  Abbilities of
`tildify.el' are a little limited; if you have improvement suggestions, let
me know.")

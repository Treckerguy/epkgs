 :commentary "\
`tex-wcount-mode' is a minor mode that puts into the modeline a running
count of the words in a latex buffer.  It uses the program detex, which must
be installed on the  host system. The mode runs tex-wcount-count when
Emacs has been idle for `tex-wcount-idleness' seconds, or when the user
presses C-c w (`tex-wcount-count'). detex uses the option -l so the word
count returned is only accurate for a latex file. This could be changed to -t
to modify the program to count words in a tex file.

tex-wcount-count was modified from wcount.el, which is:

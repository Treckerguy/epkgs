 :commentary "\
This package implements a front-end to Mario Lang's ecasound.el
(and therefore to Ecasound.)

The file ecasound.el is included with ecasound. You may download
ecasound from http://eca.cx

Terminology: An \"ecaspace\" is a library of sound projects and
recordings.  A session is a set of tracks. A track consists of an
ecasound input, a corresponding output, a set of operations to be
performed, and finally a collection of takes. A take identifies an
individual audio file. A \"take set\" is the set of new takes created
when the engine is started with record-enabled tracks.")

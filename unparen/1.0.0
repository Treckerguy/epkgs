 :commentary "\
`unparen-mode' toggles the display of parens.  While they are
hidden away, the buffer is read-only, because currently this code
does now really add and remove parens -- it just makes them
invisible.  That would be a nice feature, though.  At the moment,
this minor mode is mainly useful to show lisp code to non-lisp
coders affraid of parens.")

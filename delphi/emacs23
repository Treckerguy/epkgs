 :commentary "\
To enter Delphi mode when you find a Delphi source file, one must override
the auto-mode-alist to associate Delphi with .pas (and .dpr and .dpk)
files. Emacs, by default, will otherwise enter Pascal mode. E.g.

(autoload 'delphi-mode \"delphi\")
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (cons '(\"\\\\.\\\\(pas\\\\|dpr\\\\|dpk\\\\)$\" . delphi-mode) auto-mode-alist))

To get keyword, comment, and string literal coloring, be sure that font-lock
is running. One can manually do M-x font-lock-mode in a Delphi buffer, or
one can put in .emacs:

(add-hook 'delphi-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)

If font-lock is not loaded by default, you might have to do:

(autoload 'font-lock-mode \"font-lock\")
(autoload 'turn-on-font-lock \"font-lock\")
(setq font-lock-support-mode 'lazy-lock-mode)

Lazy lock is very necessary for faster screen updates.

For good performance, be sure to byte-compile delphi.el, e.g.

M-x byte-compile-file <give the path to delphi.el when prompted>

This will generate delphi.elc, which will be loaded instead of delphi.el
when delphi-mode is autoloaded.

When you have entered Delphi mode, you may get more info by pressing
C-h m.

This delphi mode implementation is fairly tolerant of syntax errors, relying
as much as possible on the indentation of the previous statement. This also
makes it faster and simpler, since there is less searching for properly
constructed beginnings.")

Overview
========
This library provides `multiple line edit' feature.

You can edit each side, leading and trailing edge, of
multiple line with this library.


INSTALLING
==========
To install this library, save this file to a directory in your
`load-path' (you can view the current `load-path' using \"C-h v
load-path RET\" within Emacs), then add the following line to your
.emacs startup file:

   (require 'multiple-line-edit)


USING
=====
To start multiple line edit, follow the instructions described
below.

  1. Select multiple line that you want to edit.

  2. If you want to edit the leading edges of each line,
     type `M-x mulled/edit-leading-edges RET'.

     Or if you want to edit the trailing edges of each line,
     type `M-x mulled/edit-trailing-edges RET'.

     NOTE: You can run these commands by selecting menu items
           placed in `\"Edit\" > \"Multiple Line Edit\"'.

  3. When multiple line edit is activated, the cursor will be
     moved to the 1st line of the selected lines.

     And then, your modification in the 1st line will be
     reflected to another lines automatically.

     NOTE: While multiple line edit is active, indicator icons
           will be appear on the fringes.

          (The icon `>>' will be used for leading edges edit, and
           the icon `<<' will be used for trailing edges edit)

  4. To finish multiple line edit, type `C-g' or move cursor
     to outside of the 1st line.

  `M-x customize-group RET multiple-line-edit RET'


Key map Examples
================
(global-set-key [(control c) (<)] 'mulled/edit-trailing-edges)
(global-set-key [(control c) (>)] 'mulled/edit-leading-edges)


KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============
Multiple line edit won't work with commands that sets
non-nil value to the variable `inhibit-modification-hooks'
like `YASnippet'.

We wrote experimental patches to run `YASnippet' with
`multiple-line-edit', put a line below in your .emacs startup
file if you are interested in.

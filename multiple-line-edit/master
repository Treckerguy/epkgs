Overview
========
This library provides `multiple line edit' feature.

You can edit each side, leading and trailing edge, of
multiple line with this library.


INSTALLING
==========
To install this library, save this file to a directory in your
`load-path' (you can view the current `load-path' using \"C-h v
load-path RET\" within Emacs), then add the following line to your
.emacs startup file:

   (require 'multiple-line-edit)


USING
=====
To start multiple line edit, follow the instructions described
below.

  1. Select multiple line that you want to edit.

  2. If you want to edit the leading edges of each line,
     type `M-x mulled/edit-leading-edges RET'.

     Or if you want to edit the trailing edges of each line,
     type `M-x mulled/edit-trailing-edges RET'.

     NOTE: You can run these commands by selecting menu items
           placed in `\"Edit\" > \"Multiple Line Edit\"'.

  3. When multiple line edit is activated, the cursor will be
     appeared on each selected lines.

     And then, your modification will be applied to each lines
     at a time.

     NOTE: While multiple line edit is active, indicator icons
           will be appear on the fringes if you are running Emacs
           on graphical environment like X Window System.

          (The icon `>>' will be used for leading edges edit, and
           the icon `<<' will be used for trailing edges edit)

     While you are in multiple line editing, you can toggle leading
     edge edit and trailing edge edit by commands `mulled/edit-leading-edges'
     and `mulled/edit-trailing-edges'.

     Note that multiple edit will be exit when the color of cursor
     on each line is red, it means cursor position is out of the
     range on some lines.

  4. To finish multiple line edit, type `C-g', or move cursor
     to outside of the each line.

  5. If you finished multiple line edit unexpectedly, you can
     restore multiple line edit session by command `undo'.

     This behavior is customized via user option
     `mulled/reactivate-by-undo'.

  `M-x customize-group RET multiple-line-edit RET'


COMMANDS
========
 `M-x mulled/edit-trailing-edges RET'

     Start editing on trailing edge of multiple line.
     
     You have to select lines, that you want to edit at a time,
     before you run this command.
     
     When called with prefix argument, cursor remains at current
     position.
     
     Otherwise, cursor will be moved to beginning of the lines.
     
     You can abort multiple lines edit by typing \"C-g\"
     or move cursor to outside of each line.

 `M-x mulled/edit-leading-edges RET'

     Start editing on leading edge of multiple line.
     
     You have to select lines, that you want to edit at a time,
     before you run this command.
     
     When called with prefix argument, cursor remains at current
     position.
     
     Otherwise, cursor will be moved to end of the lines.

     Force abort multiple line edit.
     Try this command when multiple line edit is broken
     by errors.


Key map Examples
================
This library does not assign keys by default.
Put lines below to your .emacs start up file then
customize them as you like.

  (global-set-key \"\\C-c<\" 'mulled/edit-trailing-edges)
  (global-set-key \"\\C-c>\" 'mulled/edit-leading-edges)


KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============
- Codes aside, this document should be rewritten.
  My English sucks :-(

- Multiple line edit won't work with commands that sets
  non-nil value to the variable `inhibit-modification-hooks'
  like `YASnippet'.
 
  We wrote experimental patches to run `YASnippet' with
  `multiple-line-edit', put a line below in your .emacs startup
  file if you are interested in.

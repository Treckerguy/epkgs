* Sets the type and creator on OSX systems based on major-mode or
  buffer-file-name.
* Yea, I know that T&C info is being phased out of OSX,
  but the process isn't complete yet.
* Kinda odd that OSX is stripping out resouce forks while Linux,
  BSD and NFSv4 are in the process of adding extended attributes
  to their filesystems.

Installation:
 Put this file somewhere in your load path and add the following to '~/.emacs':
  (when (eq system-type 'darwin)
    ;; Optionally you may want this line
    ;; (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'osx-tc-save-buffer-tc)
    (require 'osx-typecreator))
  ;; To add your own T&C info add lines like:
  (add-to-list 'osx-tc-defaults-by-mode '(foo-mode    \"FOOT\" \"FOOC\"))
  (add-to-list 'osx-tc-defaults-by-name '(\"\\\\.foo\\\\'\" \"FOOT\" \"FOOC\"))")

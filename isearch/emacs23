Instructions

For programmed use of isearch-mode, e.g. calling (isearch-forward),
isearch-mode behaves modally and does not return until the search
is completed.  It uses a recursive-edit to behave this way.

The key bindings active within isearch-mode are defined below in
`isearch-mode-map' which is given bindings close to the default
characters of the original isearch.el.  With `isearch-mode',
however, you can bind multi-character keys and it should be easier
to add new commands.  One bug though: keys with meta-prefix cannot
be longer than two chars.  Also see minibuffer-local-isearch-map
for bindings active during `isearch-edit-string'.

isearch-mode should work even if you switch windows with the mouse,
in which case isearch-mode is terminated automatically before the
switch.

The search ring and completion commands automatically put you in
the minibuffer to edit the string.  This gives you a chance to
modify the search string before executing the search.  There are
three commands to terminate the editing: C-s and C-r exit the
minibuffer and search forward and reverse respectively, while C-m
exits and does a nonincremental search.

Exiting immediately from isearch uses isearch-edit-string instead
of nonincremental-search, if search-nonincremental-instead is non-nil.
The name of this option should probably be changed if we decide to
keep the behavior.  No point in forcing nonincremental search until
the last possible moment.")

 :commentary "\
Provides support for editing GNU Cfengine files, including
font-locking, Imenu and indention, but with no special keybindings.

Possible customization for auto-mode selection:
(push '((\"^cfagent.conf\\\\'\" . cfengine-mode)) auto-mode-alist)
(push '((\"^cf\\\\.\" . cfengine-mode)) auto-mode-alist)

This is not the same as the mode written by Rolf Ebert
<ebert@waporo.muc.de>, distributed with cfengine-2.0.5.  It does
better fontification and indentation, inter alia.")

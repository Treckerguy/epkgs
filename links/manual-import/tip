This package provides integration for the 'links' browser with Emacs
(http://links.sourceforge.net).  Links is a great browser, much better than
'lynx' (IMO).  It supports frames and tables which are basically a
requirement now that HTML 4.0 is pretty much everywhere..

The integration here is important especially when compared to W3.  W3 has
performance problems when rendering tables and frames.  links.el and links
does not have this problem and in fact is blazingly fast.

links.el supports the following features.

- uses customization for all important variables.

- links-browse-url supports two types of behavior

  - browse within xterm
  -  browse within buffer

- support for launching links within an xterm.  This can be done with

- specify geomoetry, width and height,  for the xterm

- supports 'dump' integration so that we can save to a *links* buffer
directly within emacs.

- ability to jump from the links buffer to a links xterm.")

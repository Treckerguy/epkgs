The user interface for this package consists of the following commands:

       debug-on-interesting-errors
       toggle-debug-on-error
       debug-on-condition
       cancel-debug-on-condition

In addition, it modifies debugger mode to run
`after-debugger-mode-hook' after setting up the debugger but before the
user begins interacting with it.")

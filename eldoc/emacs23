 :commentary "\
This program was inspired by the behavior of the \"mouse documentation
window\" on many Lisp Machine systems; as you type a function's symbol
name as part of a sexp, it will print the argument list for that
function.  Behavior is not identical; for example, you need not actually
type the function name, you need only move point around in a sexp that
calls it.  Also, if point is over a documented variable, it will print
the one-line documentation for that variable instead, to remind you of
that variable's meaning.

One useful way to enable this minor mode is to put the following in your
.emacs:

     (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'turn-on-eldoc-mode)
     (add-hook 'lisp-interaction-mode-hook 'turn-on-eldoc-mode)
     (add-hook 'ielm-mode-hook 'turn-on-eldoc-mode)

Major modes for other languages may use ElDoc by defining an
appropriate function as the buffer-local value of
`eldoc-documentation-function'.")

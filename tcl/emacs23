CUSTOMIZATION NOTES:
* tcl-proc-list can be used to customize a list of things that
\"define\" other things.  Eg in my project I put \"defvar\" in this
list.
* tcl-typeword-list is similar, but uses font-lock-type-face.
* tcl-keyword-list is a list of keywords.  I've generally used this
for flow-control words.  Eg I add \"unwind_protect\" to this list.
* tcl-builtin-list lists commands to be given font-lock-builtin-face.
* tcl-type-alist can be used to minimally customize indentation
according to context.

KNOWN BUGS:
* In Tcl \"#\" is not always a comment character.  This can confuse tcl.el
  in certain circumstances.  For now the only workaround is to use
  font-lock which will mark the # chars accordingly or enclose offending
  hash characters in quotes or precede them with a backslash.  Note that
  using braces won't work -- quotes change the syntax class of characters
  between them, while braces do not.  If you don't use font-lock, the
  electric-# mode helps alleviate this problem somewhat.
* indent-tcl-exp is untested.

TODO:
* make add-log-tcl-defun smarter.  should notice if we are in the
  middle of a defun, or between defuns.  should notice if point is
  on first line of defun (or maybe even in comments before defun).
* Allow continuation lines to be indented under the first argument
  of the preceding line, like this:
     [list something \\
           something-else]
* There is a request that indentation work like this:
       button .fred -label Fred \\
                    -command {puts fred}
* Should have tcl-complete-symbol that queries the inferior process.
* Should have describe-symbol that works by sending the magic
  command to a tclX process.
* Need C-x C-e binding (tcl-eval-last-exp).
* Write indent-region function that is faster than indenting each
  line individually.
* tcl-figure-type should stop at \"beginning of line\" (only ws
  before point, and no \"\\\" on previous line).  (see tcl-real-command-p).
* overrides some comint keybindings; fix.
* Trailing \\ will eat blank lines.  Should deal with this.
  (this would help catch some potential bugs).
* Inferior should display in half the screen, not the whole screen.
* Indentation should deal with \"switch\".
* Consider writing code to find help files automatically (for
  common cases).
* `#' shouldn't insert `\\#' when point is in string.")

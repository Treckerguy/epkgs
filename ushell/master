This is a Universal Shell inspired by the Symbolics Genera
operating system. In designing ushell I started with what I could
learn about Genera from the various manuals I was able to get a
hold of, and also watched a fascinating video (link below) of a
user playing with Genera. I'd like to extend it with a few ideas of
my own, and hopefully the result will be something unique.

You can see a 20+ minute video of Genera at
http://www.lemonodor.com/archives/misc-gems/lispm.mov.gz My first
thought after seeing it was \"I just saw the Emacs of the future.\"

Some old Genera manuals can be found at
http://www.andreas.org/genera/Programming%20the%20User%20Interface.pdf

Features of ushell:

 - A mega-extensible self-documenting command-line interface for
   absolutely everything---Emacs Lisp, Common Lisp, UNIX
   programs/shells, etc. inspired by Symbolics Genera

 - Comprehensive mouse support

 - Generic data presentation UI makes different interfaces possible

 - Interactively construct calls to any function/command/UNIX
   program/whatever, by choosing arguments with keyboard/mouse

 - Command output can be plain text like a normal shell, or
   clickable text (such as a pop-up menu for every file that
   appears in a directory listing), or a picture, or an interactive
   dialog box with options and a \"go\" button. You can save the
   entire log as a sort of history, and save commonly-used forms
   for later re-use.

 - Integrated event notification and logging system.

 - Undoubtedly boatloads of other stuff.")

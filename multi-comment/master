 :commentary "\
Provides `multi-comment-mode', which is suitable for putting on a
programming language major mode hook.  It uses the multi-mode
facility to edit comments and strings in Text mode.  Thus, when
editing such regions of the buffer, you'll get, for instance, the
normal text-mode syntax, keymap, abbrevs, and hook functions
(e.g. flyspell).  Keybindings in the text-mode buffer inherit from
the base buffer, although they act with the wrong syntax table.
There's a special case attempt to make M-q, M-j, and C-M-j DTRT by
acting in the base buffer; there may be others worth doing.

The behaviour depends on functions from newcomment.el, which may
not be robust and rely on `comment-start-skip' being defined in the
base major mode.")

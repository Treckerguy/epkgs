 :commentary "\
The function `pb-popup' may be attached to a process filter, via
whatever hook mechanism available or by direct call, to make sure
that a window with a buffer's recently added contents is visible.

If no such window is visible, it splits the largest visible window
(according to various parameters; see the variables below) and
displays the portion of the process buffer with the most recently
inserted text.  This is done rather than moving point in an
existing window (if any show the buffer at all) because it is
assumed that if you are elsewhere in the buffer, it is for a
reason.  Likewise, it doesn't take over other windows, but creates
always creates a new one.

You can also choose to create new frames instead of splitting windows.

This functionality can be disabled at any time by disabling
pb-popup-mode.  This variable can be made buffer-local, but it is
not by default.

For an example of this library's usage, see comint-popup.el.")

You should always be able to find the latest version here:

           <URL:http://edward.oconnor.cx/elisp/soap.el>

This is the barest of beginnings of SOAP support for Emacs. It
really doesn't do much of anything; to see how to use it, see
google.el. Someone who cares about SOAP should probably make
this into an actual SOAP implementation.

This code requires a CVS version of the URL package, which you
may find here:

        <URL:http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/url/>

TODO: I'd like to change this to use http-{get,post}.el instead of
      URL, but it looks like http-post.el isn't full-featured enough.
      Perhaps I'll send them a patch at some point.")

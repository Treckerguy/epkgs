 :commentary "\
This package tries to simply fink daily administration work(not all
but most frequent commands) by using Emacs' ido features for
completing package names. It's modelled after `wajig.el' which I
wrote for Debian GNU/Linux.

Put this file into your load-path and the following into your
~/.emacs:
          (require 'fink)")

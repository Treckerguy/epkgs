 :commentary "\
A bunch of modes (e.g. Eldoc) exist that display information about the cursor
position in the echo area.  Unfortunately, these modes will often fight for
the echo area and there is no way to specify a priority.  echo-pick aims to
provide a way to prioritize these messages, or even to display multiple
messages at once.

To specify the priorities edit `echo-pick-function-list', then enable
`echo-pick-mode' and don't forget to disable the other modes' echo messages.
If they can't be turned off, maybe you can set a very long timeout.

`echo-pick-mode' respects a lot of Eldoc's settings, including
`eldoc-message-commands'.

Here's an example of how a list of functions could look like:

(setq echo-pick-function-list
      `((git-blame-mode . git-blame-identify)
        (lambda () (get-char-property (point) 'help-echo))
        (lambda () (let ((this-command nil)
                         (last-command (aref eldoc-message-commands 0))
                         (eldoc-mode t)
                         (eldoc-documentation-function nil))
                     (eldoc-print-current-symbol-info)))
        (when (eq major-mode 'emacs-lisp-mode) eldoc-documentation-function)
        (lambda () (save-excursion semantic-idle-summary-idle-function))))")

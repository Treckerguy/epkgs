M-x xtide displays a tide height graph in Emacs using the \"tide\" program
from XTide (http://www.flaterco.com/xtide).

M-x calendar is extended with a \"T\" key to display the tides for the
selected day (like \"S\" does for sunrise/sunset).

The graph is a PNG image if your display supports that, otherwise XTide's
ascii-art fallback.  Left and right arrow keys move forward or back in
time.  The various alternative displays from xtide like \"p\" plain times
can be viewed too, see the mode help \"C-h m\" or the XTide menu for the
possibilities.

The location is taken from a customizable `xtide-location' variable, or
if that's not set then from the XTIDE_DEFAULT_LOCATION environment
variable which xtide uses.  If neither is set then M-x xtide starts with
the xtide-location-mode selector.  The \"l\" key goes there too, to look at
a different place.  In the selector if you find a place close to what you
want then try \"d\" to sort by distance for nearby places.  If you've set
`calendar-latitude' and `calendar-longitude' for your location then try
\"C-u d\" to sort by distance from there.")

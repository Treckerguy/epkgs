 :commentary "\
Clipper is a way to handle 'clips' of text with some persistance via handles.
A good example is something like the GNU Public License.  If you do a lot of
Free Software work and need to have a copy of the GPL for insertion in your
source files, you can save this text as a 'GPL' clip.  When you call
clipper-insert you will be prompted for a name and when you enter GPL this
will be inserted.

Clipper can also perform search and replacement on token names.  For example
if want the current buffer filename you can use the token
CLIPPER_FILE_NAME_NONDIRECTORY.

Available tokens are:

    CLIPPER_FILE_NAME_NONDIRECTORY

        The current filename without it's directory.  If this buffer isn't
        backed on disk then the buffer name is used.

    CLIPPER_FILE_NAME_NONDIRECTORY_SANS_EXTENSION

        The current filename without it's directory and without an extension.")

Bookmark+: extensions to standard library `bookmark.el'.

   The Bookmark+ libraries are:

   `bookmark+.el'     - main code library (this file)
   `bookmark+-lit.el' - code for highlighting bookmarks (optional)
   `bookmark+-doc.el' - documentation (comment-only file)
   `bookmark+-chg.el' - change log (comment-only file)

   The documentation (in `bookmark+-doc.el') includes how to
   byte-compile and install Bookmark+.  The documentation is also
   available in these ways:

   1. From the bookmark list (`C-x r l'):
      Use `?' to show the current bookmark-list status and general
      help, then click link `Doc in Commentary' or link `Doc on the
      Web'.

   2. From the Emacs-Wiki Web site:
      http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/BookmarkPlus.
   
   3. From the Bookmark+ group customization buffer:
      `M-x customize-group bookmark-plus', then click link
      `Commentary'.

   (The commentary links in #1 and #3 work only if you have library
   `bookmark+-doc.el' in your `load-path'.)


   ****** NOTE ******

     On 2010-06-18, I changed the prefix used by package Bookmark+
     from `bookmarkp-' to `bmkp-'.  THIS IS AN INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE.
     I apologize for the inconvenience, but the new prefix is
     preferable for a number of reasons, including easier
     distinction from standard `bookmark.el' names.

     This change means that YOU MUST MANUALLY REPLACE ALL
     OCCURRENCES of `bookmarkp-' by `bmkp-' in the following
     places, if you used Bookmark+ prior to this change:

     1. In your init file (`~/.emacs') or your `custom-file', if
        you have one.  This is needed if you customized any
        Bookmark+ features.

     2. In your default bookmark file, `bookmark-default-file'
        (`.emacs.bmk'), and in any other bookmark files you might
        have.

     3. In your `*Bookmark List*' state file,
        `bmkp-bmenu-state-file' (`~/.emacs-bmk-bmenu-state.el').

     4. In your `*Bookmark List*' commands file,
        `bmkp-bmenu-commands-file' (`~/.emacs-bmk-bmenu-commands.el'),
        if you have one.

     Again, sorry for this inconvenience.")

This package enhances Emacs's minibuffer completion mechanism.

In short, this is icomplete.el + iswitchb.el +/- something.

Features:
 * supports 2 completion methods (prefix and substring matching).
   Prefix matching is the Emacs's default completion method.
   Substring matching is a completion method where all the
   completion commands work in terms of a substring of the
   all possible completions.
   e.g.  \"buffer\" matches \"backup-buffer\", \"buffer-name\",
                                  ^^^^^^    ^^^^^^
         \"exit-minibuffer\", ...
                   ^^^^^^

   You can cycle through the completion methods by `C-n' and
   `C-p' in the minibuffer.

 * displays possible completion candidates in the minibuffer.
   e.g. When you enter `M-x apr', the minibuffer looks like
        the following:
        M-x apr[opos]{,-command,-documentation,-value,-zippy}

 * `RET' in the minibuffer picks the first candidate displayed.
   e.g. `M-x apr RET' selects `apropos' command (and execute it).

   You can cycle through the candidates by `C-s' and `C-r'.

   When you want to give the exact string you entered, use `M-RET'
   or `ESC RET'.

 * `C-c' in the minibuffer toggles case significance in completion.

 * supports faces (highlights the display).

 * supports customization per user command.


Requirements:

Tested with GNU Emacs 20.7.2, GNU Emacs 21.0.91.1 and XEmacs 21.1.9.


Compatibility:

complete.el
  tab, space, ... is used for mcomplete-mode.
  M-tab, M-SPACE, ... might work.

completing-help.el (>= version 3.3)
  With this packege, short descriptions on completions is displayed
  by pressing `?'.

  You can get completing-help.el at
  http://homepage1.nifty.com/bmonkey/emacs/elisp/completing-help.el

icomplete.el
  icomplete-mode gets turned off when mcomplete-mode is activated.

ido.el (http://hjem.get2net.dk/storm/emacs/)
  Both work. ido commands take precedence.

iswitchb.el
  Both work. iswitchb commands take precedence.")

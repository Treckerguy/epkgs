 :commentary "\
This minor mode will add little +/- displays to foldable regions in the
buffer and to folded regions. It is indented to be used in conjunction with
hideshow.el which is a part of GNU Emacs since version 20.

Currently it works for me but is not tested heavily. Please report any bugs
to the above email address

Installation:
Add the following to your .emacs:

(autoload 'hideshowvis-enable \"hideshowvis\" \"Highlight foldable regions\")

(autoload 'hideshowvis-minor-mode
  \"hideshowvis\"
  \"Will indicate regions foldable with hideshow in the fringe.\"
  'interactive)


(dolist (hook (list 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
                    'c++-mode-hook))
  (add-hook hook 'hideshowvis-enable))

If enabling hideshowvis-minor-mode is slow on your machine use M-x,
customize-option, hideshowvis-ignore-same-line and set it to nil. This will
then display - icons for foldable regions of one line, too but is faster

At the end of this file you will find code to add to your .emacs to enable
displaying a + symbol in the fringe for folded regions. It is not enabled by
default because it might interfere with custom hs-set-up-overlay functions

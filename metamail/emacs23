Note: Metamail does not have all the options which are compatible with
the environment variables.  For that reason, metamail.el has to
hack the environment variables.  In addition, there is no way to
display all header fields without extra informative body messages
which are suppressed by the \"-q\" option.

The idea of using metamail to process MIME messages is from
gnus-mime.el by Spike <Spike@world.std.com>.")

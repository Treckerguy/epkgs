 :commentary "\
extract-ical provides send-invite-to-ical to extract an
icalendar event from a buffer, write it to a temporary
file, and open iCal such that the extracted event is imported.

send-invite-to-ical-from-gnus allows you to run this function from
gnus on articles containing icalendar event invitations.  You can
cal extract-ical-gnus-insinuate in your init file to set 'C-c i' as
the binding for importing icalendar invites from an article into
iCal.

You can tell extract-ical where to write its temporary file by
setting the extract-ical-invite-file variable below.")

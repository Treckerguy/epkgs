 :commentary "\
The iCalendar package aims at providing an implementation of the
iCalendar standard, as defined in ``RFC 2445 -- Internet Calendaring
and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar)''.  It provides a
means for importing [iv]Calendar data into Emacs diary files and vice
versa.

  Importing should work correctly for ``ordinary'',
i.e. non-recurring, events.  Recurring events may not be imported
correctly, if they are imported at all.  Exporting of diary files into
iCalendar files should work correctly for most diary entries.  Please
note that icalendar.el is work in progress, so usage may evolve in
future.

  To activate the package, use (require 'icalendar), or

(autoload 'icalendar-import-buffer \"icalendar\"
          \"Import iCalendar data from current buffer\" t)
(autoload 'icalendar-import-file \"icalendar\"
          \"Import iCalendar data from a file\" t)
(autoload 'icalendar-export-file \"icalendar\"
          \"Export diary data in a file\" t)
(autoload 'icalendar-export-region \"icalendar\"
          \"Export diary data in a region\" t)

(or use `update-directory-autoloads').

  The command icalendar-import-buffer extracts iCalendar data from the
current buffer and adds it to your (default) diary file.  It can be
used interactively, or for automatic extraction of iCalendar data; for
example with the VM mail reader one could use:

(add-hook 'vm-select-new-message-hook 'icalendar-import-buffer)

  The command icalendar-import-file imports an iCalendar file and
adds the result to an Emacs diary file.  For example:

(icalendar-import-file \"/here/is/calendar.ics\" \"/there/goes/ical-diary\")

The import file can be added to the diary using an #include directive.
See Fancy Diary Display in The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual.

  Use icalendar-export-file to interactively export an Emacs diary.

(icalendar-export-file \"/here/is/my-diary\" \"/there/goes/calendar.ics\")

To export only a part of a diary file, mark the respective area, and
call icalendar-export-region.  In both cases the result is appended to
the target file.

  Please note:
- Diary entries which have a start time but no end time are assumed to
  last for one hour when they are exported.
- Weekly diary entries are assumed to occur the first time in the first
  week of the year 2000 when they are exported.
- Yearly diary entries are assumed to occur the first time in the year
  1900 when they are exported.")

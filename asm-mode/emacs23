This mode was written by Eric S. Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com>,
inspired by an earlier asm-mode by Martin Neitzel.

This minor mode is based on text mode.  It defines a private abbrev table
that can be used to save abbrevs for assembler mnemonics.  It binds just
five keys:

	TAB		tab to next tab stop
	:		outdent preceding label, tab to tab stop
	comment char	place or move comment
			asm-comment-char specifies which character this is;
			you can use a different character in different
			Asm mode buffers.
	C-j, C-m	newline and tab to tab stop

Code is indented to the first tab stop level.

This mode runs two hooks:
  1) An asm-mode-set-comment-hook before the part of the initialization
depending on asm-comment-char, and
  2) an asm-mode-hook at the end of initialization.")

This mode is intended for use with languages that adds a small
number of extra letters not available on the keyboard.

Examples includes Scandinavian and German with an US keyboard.

The idea is that certain keys are overloaded.  When you press it
once it will insert one string, and when you press it twice the
string will be replaced by another.  This can be used for mapping
keys on a US keyboard to generate characters according to the local
keyboard convention when pressed once, and according to US keyboard
convention when pressed twice.

To use this mode, you must define the variable `double-map' and
then enable double mode with `M-x double-mode'.  Read the
documentation for both of them.

The default mapping is for getting Danish/Norwegian keyboard layout
using ISO Latin 1 on a US keyboard.

Important node: While I would like to hear comments, bug reports,
suggestions, please do @strong{not} expect me to put other mappings
than the default into this file.  There are billions and billions
of such mappings, and just supporting the most common would
increase the size of this nice small file manyfold.")

----------
Motivation
----------

Maintaining a faq page is not a easy work, especially when this faq
page is growing. You have to corret mistakes, re-order the questions
and so on. When the page growing, a index in the head of page is
necessary, which is just the source of all maintainning problems.

Edit the faq page by using EmacsWiki is a good idea. EmacsWiki make you
feel like writing but not programming(that was what I think of editing
HTML page). In other ways, faq page is something predicable and what
EmacsWiki do not have is some key-bindings and indexing facilities. I
write this minor mode to solve that problem and to share my experience
in editing and maintaining a faq pages.

-----------------
How does it work?
-----------------

faq-mode work on entry templates. It assume that each entry in faq page
follow a prior template(can be configured in `faq-entry-template'). The
template consisit of there part:anchor, title and body. By search according
to the regexp of anchor or title, all entries can be easily found. Thus
we can apply some replacing and formating magics on it.
 
-----
Usage
-----

faq-mode is provided as minor mode of EmacsWiki. Place

    (require 'faq-mode)

in your .emacs file to load it. M-x faq-mode to toggle it.

faq-mode need not very special configuration in your .emacs. Default it
have these key bindings

    C-c C-q C-i    Insert a new faq entry
    C-c C-q n      Move cursor to next faq entry
    C-c C-q p      Move cursor to previous faq entry
    C-c C-q C-a    Automatic index all faq entries
    C-c C-q C-m    Automatic index all faq entries and generate a link list

try these keys in emacs-wiki page:)

NOTE: Defaultly C-c C-q C-m will generate a link list at point or between

    <!-- faq index begin -->
                            |<- Index will be generated here.
    <!-- faq index end -->

so place above 2 comment lines to right place as your wish.

Faq entry template and other variables can also be configurated in wiki
page. Here is a example

    <!-- faq-mode configuration in page
    faq-entry-template:#faq
    faq-entry-template:**Q:** 
    faq-entry-template:
    faq-entry-template:<blockquote>
    faq-entry-template:**A:** 
    faq-entry-template:</blockquote>
    faq-entry-template:<hr style=\"clear:left;\">
    //faq-mode configuration in page -->

place above HTML comment fragment in your wiki page's foot and when you
open that file faq-mode will discover it. After toggle faq minor mode on,
it will read variable's configuration and configurate it. Variable
configuration is in form

    NAME:VALUE

and all page configurable variables are

    `faq-entry-template' `faq-anchor-regexp' `faq-title-regexp'
    `faq-auto-index-format' `faq-make-index-format'

NOTE: Configurating `faq-entry-template' is something different, in which
each line configuration represent one line and all configuration will be 
`concat' together.")

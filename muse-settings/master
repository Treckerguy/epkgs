 :commentary "\
Configuring muse can be fairly difficult. There are a lot of
different options that you might want to set. Currently, these get
set up in your .emacs; this is irritating because if you move the
project, the settings need to change. Also, you can't version the
wiki code and the lisp required for the publication process. This
file attempts to address this need, by allowing settings to be
placed in a local directory file and automatically loaded.")

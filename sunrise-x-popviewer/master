 :commentary "\
This extension redefines several Sunrise Commander functions in order to make
the viewer window \"float\", i.e. instead of having a dedicated window  sitting
under  the  panes  all  the  time, a new frame is displayed whenever the user
requests to view a file (by pressing \"o\" or \"v\") or to open a command line in
the current directory.

WARNING:  This  code and the Buttons extension (sunrise-x-buttons) do NOT mix
together, if you're using the Buttons extension remove  it  first  from  your
.emacs file.

Installation and Usage:

1) Put this file somewhere in your emacs load-path.

2)  If  you  are  currently  using the Buttons extension (sunrise-x-buttons),
remove it first from your .emacs file.

2)  Add  a  (require 'sunrise-x-popviewer)   expression  to  your .emacs file
somewhere after the (require 'sunrise-commander) one.

3) Evaluate the new expression, or reload your .emacs file, or restart emacs.

4)  The  next  time  you invoke the Sunrise Commander, only two panes will be
displayed. If you press o (or v) on a file inside any of  them,  it  will  be
displayed  in  a  new  frame.  If  you  press C-c t to open a terminal in the
current directory, it'll be opened in a new frame too.

5) Enjoy ;-)")

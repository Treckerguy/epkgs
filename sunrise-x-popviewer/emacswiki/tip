This extension redefines several Sunrise Commander functions in order to make
the viewer window \"float\", i.e. instead of having a dedicated window  sitting
under  the  panes  all  the  time, a new frame is displayed whenever the user
requests to view a file (by pressing \"o\" or \"v\") or to open a command line in
the current directory.

WARNING:  This  code and the Buttons extension (sunrise-x-buttons) do NOT mix
together, if you're using the Buttons extension remove  it  first  from  your
.emacs file.

This is version 1 $Rev: 315 $ of the Sunrise Commander PopViewer Extension.

This  piece  of code is still in alpha stage. If you find it useful and think
you may contribute to it with suggestions of even more code,  please  let  me
know  by sending a message to the comp.emacs newsgroup.

Installation and Usage:

1) Put this file somewhere in your emacs load-path.

2)  If  you  are  currently  using the Buttons extension (sunrise-x-buttons),
remove it first from your .emacs file.

2)  Add  a  (require 'sunrise-x-popviewer)   expression  to  your .emacs file
somewhere after the (require 'sunrise-commander) one.

3) Evaluate the new expression, or reload your .emacs file, or restart emacs.

4)  The  next  time  you invoke the Sunrise Commander, only two panes will be
displayed. If you press o (or v) on a file inside any of  them,  it  will  be
displayed  in  a  new  frame.  If  you  press C-c t to open a terminal in the
current directory, it'll be opened in a new frame too.

5) Enjoy ;-)")

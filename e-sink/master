 :commentary "\
The following applies to the \"--cmd\" option, which was the default at the time.

  First of all this thing is slow.  So don't use it if you can help it.  Pipe
  to a file and use Emacs to view that file instead.

  I have made a couple of optimizations to hopefully make it slightly faster:

   1. `e-sink.pl' tries to minimize invocations of \"emacsclient\" by
      maximizing the command-line buffer.

   2. It also does non-blocking read from the source.  So the data source
      doesn't hang there waiting for emacsclient invocations.")

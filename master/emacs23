master-mode is a minor mode which enables you to scroll another
buffer (the slave) without leaving your current buffer (the master).

It can be used by sql.el, for example: The SQL buffer is the master
and its SQLi buffer is the slave.  This allows you to scroll the SQLi
buffer containing the output from the SQL buffer containing the
commands.

This is how to use sql.el and master.el together: The variable
sql-buffer contains the slave buffer.  It is a local variable in the
SQL buffer.

(add-hook 'sql-mode-hook
	   (function (lambda ()
		       (master-mode t)
		       (master-set-slave sql-buffer))))
(add-hook 'sql-set-sqli-hook
	   (function (lambda ()
		       (master-set-slave sql-buffer))))

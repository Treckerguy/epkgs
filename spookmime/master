Original concept by Bryan O'Sullivan <bos@serpentine.com>.

The function spookmime-make-mime-boundary returns a string which is
suitable for use as a MIME multipart separator.  MUAs and news readers
need to be instrumented to use this routine instead of whatever default
they normally provide.  VM is already so instrumented at the end of this
package.

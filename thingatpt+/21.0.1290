 ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `thingatpt.el'
             have been REDEFINED HERE:

 `bounds-of-thing-at-point' - Added optional argument SYNTAX-TABLE.
 `form-at-point'            - Added optional argument SYNTAX-TABLE.
 `list-at-point'            - Better behavior.
                              Added optional argument SYNTAX-TABLE.
 `symbol-at-point'          - Added optional argument NON-NIL.
 `thing-at-point'           - Added optional argument SYNTAX-TABLE.


 A reminder (the doc strings are not so good):

   These functions, defined in `thingatpt.el', all move point:
     `beginning-of-thing', `end-of-sexp', `end-of-thing',
     `forward-symbol', `forward-thing'.


 This file should be loaded after loading the standard GNU file
 `thingatpt.el'.  So, in your `~/.emacs' file, do this:
 (eval-after-load \"thingatpt\" '(require 'thingatpt+))")

WebJump provides a sort of ``programmable hotlist'' of Web sites that can
quickly be invoked in your Web browser.  Each Web site in the hotlist has a
name, and you select the desired site name via a completing string prompt in
the minibuffer.  The URL for each Web site is defined as a static string or
a built-in or custom function, allowing interactive prompting for
site-specific queries and options.

Note that WebJump was originally intended to complement your conventional
browser-based hotlist, not replace it.  (Though there's no reason you
couldn't use WebJump for your entire hotlist if you were so inclined.)

The `webjump-sites' variable, which defines the hotlist, defaults to some
example sites.  You'll probably want to override it with your own favorite
sites.  The documentation for the variable describes the syntax.

You may wish to add something like the following to your `.emacs' file:

  (require 'webjump)
  (global-set-key \"\\C-cj\" 'webjump)
  (setq webjump-sites
        (append '(
                  (\"My Home Page\" . \"www.someisp.net/users/joebobjr/\")
                  (\"Pop's Site\"   . \"www.joebob-and-son.com/\")
                  )
                webjump-sample-sites))

The above loads this package, binds `C-c j' to invoke WebJump, and adds your
personal favorite sites to the hotlist.

The `webjump-sample-sites' variable mostly contains some site entries that
are expected to be generally relevant to most Emacs users.  Some additional
site entries are defined in the separate and more frequently updated
`webjump-plus' package, which is available from the author's Web site.

The `browse-url' package is used to submit URLs to the browser, so any
browser-specific configuration should be done there.

WebJump inherits a small amount code from my `altavista.el' package, and is
intended to obsolete that package.")

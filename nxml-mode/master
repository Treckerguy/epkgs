 :commentary "\
To use this include rng-auto.el in your .emacs.

See nxml-rap.el for description of parsing strategy.

The font locking here is independent of font-lock.el.  We want to
do more sophisticated handling of changes and we want to use the
same xmltok rather than regexps for parsing so that we parse
consistently and correctly.")

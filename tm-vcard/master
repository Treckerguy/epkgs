 :commentary "\
Noah Friedman wrote a generic bit of Emacs Lisp to parse VCard
data, saying \"it'd be neat if somebody made this work with TM, so
Gnus and RMAIL can use it.\" - here goes...

You'll need to get vcard.el from
http://www.splode.com/users/friedman/software/emacs-lisp/

Once it's all installed, you can add something like

(call-after-loaded 'tm-view (function (lambda () (require 'tm-vcard) (tm-vcard-install))))

to activate it

This code is available from http://bing.bofh.asn.au/sw/emacs-lisp/")

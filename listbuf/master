 :commentary "\
The standard list-buffers command is a primitive in Emacs 18, but no
other primitives call it (that I know of), so it can be replaced in a
reliable way here.  In most variants of Emacs 19, it's a lisp function
anyway.  Put this program in a separate file somewhere in your load path
and put the line

       (load \"listbuf\")
or
       (autoload 'listbuf \"listbuf\" nil t)

somewhere in your .emacs file.  You might also wish to do one (but
not all) of the following:

       (substitute-key-definition 'list-buffers 'listbuf ctl-x-map)
   or
       (defalias 'list-buffers 'listbuf)
   or
       (defadvice list-buffers (around listbuf activate)
         (apply 'listbuf (ad-get-args 0)))

The last option is probably the cleanest to undo if necessary.

This package does not use customs because it strives to work with Emacs
18 and 19, which did not support that interface.")

 :commentary "\
This is a simple presentation mode for Emacs.  It works best in
Emacs 23, which has nicer font rendering.

To use, invoke epresent-run-frame in an outline-mode buffer.  This
will make a full-screen frame.  Use n/p to navigate, or q to quit.
(There are some other key bindings too.)  Some special markup is
available as well:

  \"#\" marks a comment line
  \"* @Something\" means that this outline node starts a new page
  \"@toc\" by itself on a line means to insert a table-of-contents here
  \"[File Text]\" means insert FILE as an image, with TEXT underneath
  \"=Text=\" means to format text using a mono font, useful for code

Probably this should be redone as a muse back end, using muse
markup instead.")

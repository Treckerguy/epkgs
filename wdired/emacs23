wdired.el (the \"w\" is for writable) provides an alternative way of
renaming files.

Have you ever wished to use C-x r t (string-rectangle), M-%
(query-replace), M-c (capitalize-word), etc... to change the name of
the files in a \"dired\" buffer? Now you can do this.  All the power
of Emacs commands are available to renaming files!

This package provides a function that makes the filenames of a a
dired buffer editable, by changing the buffer mode (which inhibits
all of the commands of dired mode). Here you can edit the names of
one or more files and directories, and when you press C-c C-c, the
renaming takes effect and you are back to dired mode.

Another things you can do with WDired:

- To move files to another directory (by typing their path,
  absolute or relative, as a part of the new filename).

- To change the target of symbolic links.

- To change the permission bits of the filenames (in systems with a
  working unix-alike `dired-chmod-program'). See and customize the
  variable `wdired-allow-to-change-permissions'.  To change a single
  char (toggling between its two more usual values) you can press
  the space bar over it or left-click the mouse.  To set any char to
  an specific value (this includes the SUID, SGID and STI bits) you
  can use the key labeled as the letter you want.  Please note that
  permissions of the links cannot be changed in that way, because
  the change would affect to their targets, and this would not be
  WYSIWYG :-).

- To mark files for deletion, by deleting their whole filename.

Installation:

Add this file (byte-compiling it is recommended) to your load-path.
Then add one of these set of lines (or similar ones) to your config:

This is the easy way:

(require 'wdired)
(define-key dired-mode-map \"r\" 'wdired-change-to-wdired-mode)

This is the recommended way for faster Emacs startup time and lower
memory consumption:

(autoload 'wdired-change-to-wdired-mode \"wdired\")
(eval-after-load \"dired\"
          '(lambda ()
             (define-key dired-mode-map \"r\" 'wdired-change-to-wdired-mode)
             (define-key dired-mode-map
               [menu-bar immediate wdired-change-to-wdired-mode]
               '(\"Edit File Names\" . wdired-change-to-wdired-mode))))

Type \"M-x customize-group RET wdired\" if you want to make changes
to the default behavior.")

End User Interface
==================
The variable `mail-user-agent' contains a symbol indicating which
Emacs mail package end users would like to use to compose outgoing
mail.  See that variable for details.

Mail Package Interface
======================
Mail package authors can configure reporter to support their
package by calling the function `define-mail-user-agent' See that
function for details.

Lisp Package Authors
====================
Reporter was written primarily for Emacs Lisp package authors so
that their users can easily report bugs.  When invoked,
reporter-submit-bug-report will set up an outgoing mail buffer with
the appropriate bug report address, including a lisp expression the
maintainer of the package can eval to completely reproduce the
environment in which the bug was observed (e.g. by using
eval-last-sexp).  This package proved especially useful during my
development of cc-mode, which is highly dependent on its
configuration variables.

Do a \"C-h f reporter-submit-bug-report\" for more information.
Here's an example usage:

(defconst mypkg-version \"9.801\")
(defconst mypkg-maintainer-address \"mypkg-help@foo.com\")
(defun mypkg-submit-bug-report ()
 \"Submit via mail a bug report on mypkg\"
 (interactive)
 (reporter-submit-bug-report
  mypkg-maintainer-address
  (concat \"mypkg.el \" mypkg-version)
  (list 'mypkg-variable-1
        'mypkg-variable-2
        ;; ...
        'mypkg-variable-last)))

Mailing List
============
I've set up a Majordomo mailing list to report bugs or suggest
enhancements, etc.  This list's intended audience is elisp package
authors who are using reporter and want to stay current with
releases. Here are the relevant addresses:

Administrivia: reporter-request@python.org
Submissions:   reporter@python.org

Packages that currently use reporter are: cc-mode, supercite, elp,
tcl, ediff, crypt++ (crypt), dired-x, rmailgen, mode-line, vm,
mh-e, edebug, archie, viper, w3-mode, framepop, hl319, hilit19,
pgp, eos, hm--html, efs.

If you know of others, please email me!")

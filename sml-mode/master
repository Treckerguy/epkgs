HISTORY

Still under construction: History obscure, needs a biographer as
well as a M-x doctor. Change Log on request.

Hacked by Olin Shivers for comint from Lars Bo Nielsen's sml.el.

Hacked by Matthew Morley to incorporate Fritz Knabe's hilite and
font-lock patterns, some of Steven Gilmore's (reduced) easy-menus,
and numerous bugs and bug-fixes.

DESCRIPTION

See accompanying info file: sml-mode.info

FOR YOUR .EMACS FILE

If sml-mode.el lives in some non-standard directory, you must tell
emacs where to get it. This may or may not be necessary:

(add-to-list 'load-path \"~jones/lib/emacs/\")

Then to access the commands autoload sml-mode with that command:

(load \"sml-mode-startup\")

sml-mode-hook is run whenever a new sml-mode buffer is created.

Finally, there are inferior-sml-{mode,load}-hooks -- see comments
in sml-proc.el. For much more information consult the mode's *info*
tree.")

This package provides a more intuitive way of replace-string operation:

- Select the occurrence in the buffer
  In Transient Mark mode, just mark a region, the content of the 
  region will be used as the occurrence. (if Transient Mark mode is disabled,
  using C-u C-x C-x or C-SPC C-SPC to activate it just for this one time).

- Start iedit minor mode - by press C-;
  All occurrences of the content in the buffer are highlighted

- Edit one of the contents
  The change is applied to other contents simultaneously

- Finish - by pressing C-; again

If Transient Mark mode is disabled or the region is not active,
the `current-word' is used as the occurrence by default.

You can also switch to iedit mode from isearch mode directly. The current
search string is used as the occurrence.

If you would like to replace-string on certain region, use \"narrowing\" first.

Suggested key bindings:

(define-key global-map (kbd \"C-;\") 'iedit-mode)
(define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd \"C-;\") 'iedit-mode)")

 Suggested key bindings:

  (global-set-key [(control meta ?y)]     'secondary-dwim)
  (define-key esc-map \"y\"                 'yank-pop-commands)
  (define-key isearch-mode-map \"\\C-\\M-y\"  'isearch-yank-secondary)

 You might want to also use library `browse-kill-ring+.el' (and
 `browse-kill-ring.el').  I do.  If you do that, then load
 `second-sel.el' first.")

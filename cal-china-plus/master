All functions are prefixed with calendar-chinese- unless it is
already in cal-china.el; in this case, it is prefixed with
calendar-chinese-plus-

*NB*: the Chinese calendar date is represented with '(month day
nl-year) instead of '(cycle year month day) in the dary file, where
nl-year is Nong-Li year offset by constant 2697. For example, Cycle
78 Year 25 is Nong-Li year 4705 but for convenience it is
represented as 2008 (i.e. 4705 - 2697) in the diary file.

Please send me any comments that you may have. Thank you.")

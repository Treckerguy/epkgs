 :commentary "\
This is a linter for Emacs Lisp.  Currently, it mainly catches
misspellings and undefined variables, although it can also catch
function calls with the wrong number of arguments.

To use, call elint-current-buffer or elint-defun to lint a buffer
or defun.  The first call runs `elint-initialize' to set up some
argument data, which may take a while.

The linter will try to \"include\" any require'd libraries to find
the variables defined in those.  There is a fair amount of voodoo
involved in this, but it seems to work in normal situations.")

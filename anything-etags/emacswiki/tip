 :commentary "\
This package use `anything' as a interface to find tag with Etags.


You can also make this package integrate with `anything',
just setup like below:

(setq anything-sources
      '(anything-etags-c-source-etags-select
       ))

If you want to use tag file in cache directory
instead current directory, example you have a
tag file in directory \"~/MyEmacs/\", and you want
always search tag in this directory.
You can setup like below:

(setq anything-etags-enable-tag-file-dir-cache t)
(setq anything-etags-cache-tag-file-dir \"~/MyEmacs/\")

Installation:

Put anything-etags.el to your load-path.
The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name \"~/elisp\"))

And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.

(require 'anything-etags)

It is good to use anything-match-plugin.el to narrow candidates.

This provides a function to display an xpath-like string 
for the yaml element on the current line.
It's meant to complement Yoshiki Kurihara's yaml-mode.el.

It doesn't strictly depend on yaml-mode, but works better
with yaml-mode.  (That's because yaml-mode makes syntax-ppss usable 
for locating comments.)

The only function you should need is yaml-path/path.  
It's convenient to bind that to a key, e.g. C-c C-p.
(Instructions for doing that only in yaml-mode are below.)

Installation:

To install, just drop this file into a directory in your
`load-path' and (optionally) byte-compile it.  To automatically
handle files ending in '.yml', add something like:

   (require 'yaml-path)

to your ~/.emacs (or ~/.emacs.d/init.el).

If you've installed yaml-mode, and would like to have C-c C-p show you the path
when you're in yaml-mode, add this to your initialization file.

   (add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook
    '(lambda ()
       (define-key yaml-mode-map (kbd \"C-c C-p\") 'yaml-path/path)))")

Description:

`annot.el' is a general and scalable annotation manager that works on GNU
Emacs.  It lets you add/remove/edit annotations and highlights on any file
and manages them for later use. All annotations are stored separately for
each annotated file and get reproduced when the file is opened again. You can
even store annotations on non-editable files.  Because annot keeps track of
md5 checksums of annotated files, annotations won't disappear even when file
names are changed.

Requirement:

GNU Emacs 23 or higher.

Installation:

Insert the following line to your .emacs:

 (require 'annot)

Keybindings:

* [C-x a]    -  add a new annotation/highlight or edit an existing annotation on point.
                You can also use [C-x C-a]. (annot-edit/add)
* [C-x r]    -  remove annotation at point. (annot-remove)
* [C-x w]    -  insert an image at point. (annot-add-image)

User Commands:

* `annot-edit/add'  - either edit the annotation at point, if there is,
                      or else add a new annotation or highlight.
* `annot-remove'    - remove the annotation/highlight at point.
* `annot-add'       - add a new annotation/highlight at point.
* `annot-edit'      - edit the annotation at point.

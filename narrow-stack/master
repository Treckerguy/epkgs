 :commentary "\
Narrowing, as implemented in Emacs has one limitation, which I find very
annoying, namely that it is not possible to narrow within a narrowing,
and then widen again to the previous narrowing.
This package implements an extension to narrowing, which makes this
possible.

This package has been developed as part of my job on writing the book
\"Sams Teach yourself Emacs in 24 hours\".
For more information about this book, please go to the page www.mcp.com
and search for the word Emacs.

To install this package, copy this file to a directory in your load-path
and insert the following into your .emacs file:
(require 'narrow-stack)
(narrow-stack-mode)

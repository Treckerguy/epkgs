;;;
;;
;; * ChangeLog *
;;
;; ics.el devel
;;
;; changes since 0.4.0:
;; * Some fixes for XEmacs -
;;   * added a require for 'overlay.  This is part of the fsf-compat
;;     XEmacs package.
;;   * added escapes into "----" and "++++" parts of regexps since
;;     not escaping them broke XEmacs version.
;;   * added test for XEmacs into function tracing devel option
;; * changed the connection mechanism slightly to use a different
;;   variable ics-interface-with-helper-args when CONNECTMETHOD in
;;   ics-servers-alist is non-nil.  This allows a different xboard
;;   commandline to be used if there is a timestamp/timeseal program
;;   available, rather than the same commandline with telnet for the
;;   helper program (which doesn't work for me anymore under Mandrake
;;   Linux 8.0 - I get a connection closed right before the password
;;   is prompted for).
;; * updated the default ics-servers-alist variable for new IP addresses
;;   and the BCF server and chess.net
;; * Fixed wholist buttonisation regexp to recognise "&" between rating
;;   and handle.
;; * Several fixes by John Wiegley to prevent ics.el from breaking other 
;;   comint based modes - ics.el now uses local hooks instead of polluting
;;   the global comint hooks.
;; * Added support for running the interface program (e.g. xboard) under
;;   gdb in the ics sessions.  The variable ics-gdb-interface controls this.
;;
;; changes since 0.3.7:
;; * Multiple small tidyups+regexp tweaks including:-
;;   * tweaked regexp to make seekads/sought output work on ICC
;;   * tweaked regexp in example auto-command-alist to know about bracketed
;;     junk after handles e.g. (U) (*) etc.
;;   * added knowledge of "'" at end of handle into emote regexp
;;   * re-ordered some button regexps to help larger buttons take precedence
;;   * tidied up ics-button-alist regexps using concat
;;   * replaced literal ^M with \r,  literal ^G with \a
;;   * fixed gamelist regexp to know that there can be more than one space in
;;     front of the gamenumber
;;   * Fixed history list regexp to know about more "ending" flags
;;   * Added some button regexps for dealing with stored games
;;   * ics.el now sets the interface variable at ICS servers to show ics.el
;;     version and the sub-interface in use.  Currently only works at FICS
;;     since ICC seems to lock the interface variable once it is set.
;;
;; changes since 0.3.6:
;; * better shout default colour for dark backgrounds (turquise).
;; * better handle default colour for dark backgrounds (orange).
;; * better kibitz default colour for dark backgrounds (LightSeaGreen)
;;   (can anybody tell I now use dark backgrounds in my emacs???)
;; * fixed type in ics-shout-face (turquiose1 -> turquoise1)
;; * fixed handle matching regexp in ics-button-alist to know that 
;;   "-" is now allowed in names.
;; * fixed sundry button regexps to know that titles in brackets exist
;; * rehashed the highlighting/buttonising code to remove
;;   the long-standing bug which caused virtually everything
;;   to turn 'bold in the buffer if it buttonised some unfinished output
;;   from the server.
;; * added knowledge of seek ads and sought output to the buttonisation
;;   code.  Clicking button issues appropriate "play" command
;; * added selected function tracing if ics-version matches *devel*
;;
;; ics.el v0.3.6 alpha
;;
;; changes since 0.3.5:
;; * added a line into ics-watch-for-login-and-send-handle to remove it 
;;   from comint-output-filter-functions once it has run,  to avoid 
;;   endless loop when an invalid handle is entered.
;; * removed all the ics-wakeup stuff.  It got broken between my
;;   prerelease version of 0.3.5 and the released version.  This has
;;   been replaced by a more general ics-auto-command feature, along
;;   with a boolean variable ics-idle-p to determine if user is idle. 
;;   A sample ics-auto-command-alist shows how to use these to simulate
;;   the broken 0.3.5 ics-wakeup feature,  along with another 
;;   auto-command (auto greet people on notify list)
;;
;; changes since 0.3.4:
;; * added timeout variable to ics-wakeup function.  Wakeup will now 
;;   only produce alarm beeps if the elapsed time since the last beeps
;;   is greater than the user settable timeout period 
;;   ics-wakeup-alarm-timeout
;; * added some messages to let user know what ics.el is doing
;;   e.g. Waiting for login prompt ... etc...
;; * ics-send-password and ics-password added.
;; * added wakeup function.  If ics-wakeup is t then any ics output 
;;   matching ics-wakeup-regexp will cause emacs to (ding t)
;;   ics-wakeup-number-of-beeps times,  separated by
;;   ics-wakeup-beep-interval. 
;; * Changed (ding) in ics-output-filter-function to (ding t) to
;;   prevent it from terminating keyboard macros.
;; * wrapped long regexp strings over multiple lines.  Must be careful not 
;;   to reformat these sections of code!
;;
;; changes since 0.3.3:
;; * CHANGED variable ics-handle to ics-default-handle.  ics-handle is
;;   now used internally.
;; * added variable ics-wait-for-login-prompt. If this is t (default) and 
;;   ics-send-handle is t, ics.el will wait for the login prompt to appear 
;;   before sending handle.
;; * added button to observe gnotify notification games.
;; * added button on "Type next/more" messages.
;; * modified buttonisation code to re-search each button regexp
;;   separately to get around the problem with overflowing the regexp
;;   matcher's stack. (minor changes to
;;   ics-add-buttons-to-region). This modification may make the
;;   buttonising too slow.  If so I'll have to group the regexps in
;;   batches of, say, 5 regexps and do it the old way for each
;;   grouping. Thankfully, though, at present the soplution appears
;;   quick enough on both my linux box (i486) and DEC alphas.
;; * uncommented some button entries which were commented because of
;;   above problem.
;; * corrected a couple of doc strings.
;;
;; changes since 0.3.2:
;; * changed ics-mouse-push-button to ics-mouse-push-button-or-yank
;;   which does a yank if there is no button at the clicked spot.
;; * more buttons (finger buttons in shouts etc.)
;; * fixed bug which would always use the default handle even if you
;;   entered a different one.
;; * changed defaults for dark backgrounds.
;; * tweaked regexps
;; * moved the variables that most need user customisation nearer the
;;   top of the file so users might see them if browsing the head of the
;;   file. 
;;
;; changes since 0.3.1:
;; * minor tweakings of regexps to work better across different ics servers
;; * new startup screen. 
;; * examine button for history list entries
;; * new hooks ics-pre-connect-hook ics-post-connect-hook and ics-mode-hook
;;

\(ABBREV SHORTNAME ADDRESS PORT CONNECTMETHOD\)

With PORT and CONNECTMETHOD optional.

For a list of current addresses see \"help addresses\" on A-FICS.

Where ABBREV is an abbreviation which you can enter at the ics server
prompt.  SHORTNAME is the name by which the server will be referred in
the buffername in the Emacs modeline.  ADDRESS is the address \(or the
IP number\) of the server.  \(If you are going to use timestamp \(help
\"timestamp\" on ICC\) or timeseal \(help \"timeseal\" on FICS\) then
for most versions, it is necessary to use the IP number.\) This will
be assigned to the (buffer-local) variable ics-address before calling
the interface program specified in ics-interface with arguments
specified in ics-interface-args.

PORT and CONNECTMETHOD are both optional.  If they are set, they will
be assigned to the variables ics-port and ics-connect-method,
respectively.  These variables may then be used in the \(user
specified\) ics-interface-args and ics-interface-with-helper-args variables
to specify hairy connect methods.  See the documentation on
ics-interface-args for an example of how to use this to use these
variables to specify the use of timestamp/timeseal with xboard when
connecting to ICC/FICS.

Typical entries might look like

\(\"icc\" \"ICC\" \"chess.lm.com\" \"5000\" \"timestamp\"\)

or

\(\"bics\" \"BICS\" \"holly.csv.warwick.ac.uk\" \"5000\" nil\)

Where the first specifies \"icc\" as an abbreviation for the ICC
server at chess.lm.com.  The second defines bics as an abbrev for BICS
at holly.csv.warwick.ac.uk.  Setting the connectmethod to nil, or omitting
it entirely, causes ics.el to use the ")

 :commentary "\
Works with the .emacs-desktop files (as generated by desktop.el),
 but unlike with desktop-read, provides an interactive menu that
 let's the user choose which buffers will be restored.

Put this file into your load-path and the following into your ~/.emacs:
 (require 'desktop-recover)
 ;; optionallly:
 (setq desktop-recover-location
    (desktop-recover-fixdir \"$HOME/.emacs.d/\")) ;; ~/.emacs.d is the default
 Something like this is highly recommended:
 (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
 ;; Brings up the interactive buffer restore menu
 (desktop-recover-interactive)
 ;; Note that after using this menu, your desktop will be saved
 ;; automatically (triggered by the auto-save mechanism).

 For finer-grained control of the frequency of desktop saves,
 you can add the standard keybindings to your set-up:
  (desktop-recover-define-global-key-bindings \"\\C-c%\")")

Reveal mode is a minor mode that makes sure that text around point
is always visible.  When point enters a region of hidden text,
`reveal-mode' temporarily makes it visible.

This is normally used in conjunction with `outline-minor-mode',
`hs-minor-mode', `hide-ifdef-mode', ...

It only works with packages that hide text using overlays.
Packages can provide special support for it by placing
a function in the `reveal-toggle-invisible' property on the symbol
used as the value of the `invisible' overlay property.
The function is called right after revealing (or re-hiding) the
text with two arguments: the overlay and a boolean that's non-nil
if we have just revealed the text.  When revealing, that function
may re-hide some of the text.")

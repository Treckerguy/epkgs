 :commentary "\
This library defines mapping macros that report progress.

For many of the standard and CL mapping functions like `mapc' macros
like `mapc-with-progress-reporter' are defined here.  The arguments
have the same meaning as the respective arguments of the respective
function and `make-progress-reporter', which ever has an argument by
the same name.

Even when the respective function supports multiple sequences the
macros defined here only support one.  One the other hand all of the
`make-progress-reporter' arguments except for MESSAGE are optional.
This includes the starting and final state argument.

Any mapping function with only exactly two mandatory arguments - a
function which is applied to a sequence - are supported by
`map-with-progress-reporter' which can be used when no specialized
macro corresponding to a particular function exists, but additional
arguments are not supported.

Therefor at least the following functions are not supported: `map'.
However support for the following divergent mapping functions has
been implemented: .")

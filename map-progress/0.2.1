 :commentary "\
This library defines mapping macros that report progress.

For many of the standard and CL mapping functions like `mapc' macros
like `mapc-with-progress-reporter' are defined here.  The arguments
have the same meaning as the respective arguments of the mapping
function or of `make-progress-reporter', which ever has an argument by
the same name.

Even when the original mapping function supports multiple sequences the
macros defined here only support one.  All of `make-progress-reporter's
arguments except for MESSAGE are optional.  This includes the starting
and final state arguments.

All standard mapping function with exactly two mandatory arguments are
supported by `map-with-progress-reporter', which can be used when no
progress reporting variant of that function has been defined here.  But
any optional arguments the original might have are not supported.")

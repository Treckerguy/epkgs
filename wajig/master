\"Wajig is an interface to many Debian administrative tasks. Written
in Python, wajig uses traditional Debian administration and user
tools including apt-get, dpkg, apt-cache, wget, and others. It is
intended to unify and simplify common administrative tasks.\" See
http://www.togaware.com/wajig/ for more infomation.

I write this package as a wrapper of wajig for Emacs. I love living
within Emacs. :-)

Put this file into your load-path and the following into your ~/.emacs:

   (autoload 'wajig \"wajig\"
            \"Create a *wajig* buffer.\" t)

Then, simply run `M-x wajig'.

Features
--------

- Ease of Typing

  Most of wajig commands can be invoked by typing very few
  keys. e.g., in *wajig* buffer, `o' for `wajig show'.

- `ido-completing-read' Support

  With the power of `ido-completing-read', you don't have to remember
  the full name of a package. It is also an ease of typing.

- Output Highlighting

  Highlight command outputs. Make them look nicer.

The Aim
-------

At first, i thought i would write an interface for wajig in
Emacs. Then i found wajig also supports some other system operations
besides deb control, such as start/stop system services. Hence, i
plan to add more system administrations, in the hope of reducing
typing in a shell as much as possible.

Important Notes
---------------

1. It's currently expected to run all the commands in a
   non-interactive style. So do have the following settings:

    - `dpkg-reconfigure debconf', and choose non-interactive
    - add the following into /etc/apt/apt.conf:

        APT {
             Get {
                  Assume-Yes \"true\";
             };
        };

2. I only tested wajig commands that i tend to use often. Far from
   all of the wajig commands! Hence, possibly some functions won't
   work properly. Be careful and let me know if you find any!")

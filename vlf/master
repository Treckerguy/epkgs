After reading the Nth post on Gnu Emacs Help about Viewing Large
Files in Emacs, it itched so much that I decided to make a try.  It
helped quite a lot when Kevin Rodgers posted a snippet on how to
use `insert-file-contents' to extract part of a file.  At first I
made a try using head and tail and that worked too, but using
internal Emacs commands is nicer.  Here is the code to extract data
using head and tail in case someone wanna try that out in the
future:

(defun vlf-extract-part-of-file (file from to)
  \"Returns bytes in FILE from FROM to TO.\"
  (let ((size (vlf-file-size file)))
    (if (or (> from size)
            (> to size))
        (error \"From or to is larger that the file size\"))
    (with-temp-buffer
      (shell-command
       (format \"head --bytes %d %s | tail --bytes %d\"
	       to file (+ (- to from) 1)) t)
      (buffer-substring (point-min) (point-max)))))")

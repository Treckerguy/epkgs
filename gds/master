 :commentary "\
gds.el provides a couple of commands to interface Google Desktop
Search (GDS) from Emacs.

gds.el should work on all operating systems where GDS exist.
Currently it seems only to exist officially in Microsoft Windows
and Mac OSX but there is supposedly some sort of beta for GNU/Linux
as well.

Basically all it does is to build a URL with the search, send it to
GDS and do different fun things with the result.  The commands
currently implemented are `gds', `gds-iswitchb-open-file' and
`gds-dired'.

It is easy to use, just customize `gds-search-url' and get going! I
recommend starting with the `gds' command.")

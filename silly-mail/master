To use this, put the following in your .emacs:

   (autoload 'sm-add-random-header \"silly-mail\" nil t)
   (add-hook 'mail-setup-hook 'sm-add-random-header)

I solicit more randomly generated headers commands.

Some of the options in this program require some external packages which
are not a standard part of emacs, e.g. shop.el and flame.el (flame.el is
present in XEmacs and Emacs 18, but missing from Emacs 19).  These are
available from http://www.splode.com/users/friedman/software/emacs-lisp/")

Functionality to supplement the different tags operations, usually
bound to M-./M-* Currently supports etags.el and gtags.el; any
others?

As you navigate through a source tree it can become easy to forget
how you got to your current location -- you could call M-*
repeatedly to pop back up the stack, but this would lose your
current location.  This module allows you to view the path taken,
and if desired to jump immediately back to any intermediate
location, delete any extranous locations, etc.

I don't think this exists, but I haven't looked too hard -- I'd
like the practice of writing something to completion for emacs for
once, before realising someone else has already provided it!
Update: ok, I went looking, and of course it exists:
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EtagsStack
I'd like to think this offers a little bit different; it supports
gtags as well out of the box and in theory at least can be
extended to others, and it offers a few more operations on the
chronological trace.  Of course, if you need any of that is up to
you :)

Bugs: Most probably.  The gtags backend in particular really
hasn't copped much testing yet.")

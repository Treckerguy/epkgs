* Attempt to compile elisp right before it is loaded.
  Only compile files which are under your chosen paths and
  are older than the source files.
* If you put '(jhg-cload-try \"~/.emacs\")' your ~/.emacs
  it will be recompiled when needed.  However, this
  method will result in one 'stale' start after a
  change is made.  (A small price to pay for auto compiles.)

NOTE: cload wont compile autoloaded functions as
do_autoload calls the c function \"Fload\" directly.  To
let devadvice get its hooks into the autoloader, try this:

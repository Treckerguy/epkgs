Purpose
-------
maxframe provides the ability to maximize the emacs frame and stay within
the display resolution.

Usage
-----
Example of lines to be added to your .emacs:

    (require 'maxframe)
    (add-hook 'window-setup-hook 'maximize-frame t)

How it works
------------
puts the emacs frame in the top left corner of the display and calculates
the maximum number of columns and rows that can fit in the display

Limitations
-----------
Requires Emacs 22 (for fringe support), but maximize-frame still works
under Emacs 21 on Windows.

Emacs does not recognize when the display's resolution is changed. This is
a problem because I would like to be able to re-maximize the frame after
connecting to a display with different resolution. Unfortunately,
display-pixel-width and display-pixel-height yield the display resolution
values from when emacs was started instead of the current display
values. Perhaps there's a way to have emacs re-sniff these values, but I'm
not yet sure how.")

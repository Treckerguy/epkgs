 :commentary "\
Even though I've been using Emacs for years, I still have trouble
remembering a lot of the key combinations for commands that I don't
use all the time (e.g.: killing and yanking rectangles, bookmarks,
etc.). I think Lotus 123 for DOS had a remarkably cool user
interface in that the menus let you explore around and find things
if you were a newbie, but once you knew the key sequences, you
could become very fast with it. This is my attempt at doing
something like the Lotus 123 menu system for Emacs.")

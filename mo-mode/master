 :commentary "\
This code adds decoding and viewing of .mo and .gmo message catalogue
files from Gettext (http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/).

A format-alist entry does the conversion between binary MO data and PO
style text in a buffer, using the msgfmt and msfunfmt programs.  The
`mo-mode' function then merely ensures that transformation has been
applied, and switches to either po-mode or text-mode.

In Emacs 22, once format-alist is setup it actually works to have
`po-mode' directly for .mo files, instead of the helper `mo-mode'.  But
`mo-mode' makes it easier to autoload the code here, it ensures decoding
works from tar-mode and archive-mode, and it fixes multibyteness when
visiting in emacs 21.

Note that `tar-mode' (as of Emacs 22) doesn't follow `buffer-file-format'
when saving so if you rewrite a .mo inside a .tar you get the PO text.
This afflicts all file format things, including the builtin
`enriched-mode'.  So don't do that.  `archive-mode' saving is ok.")

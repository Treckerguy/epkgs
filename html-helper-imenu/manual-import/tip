 :commentary "\
* Adds an indented table of contents to the menubar
* The regexp only matches headers on a single line
  and well formed tags.  (Which is pretty common.)

Put somthing like the following in your .emacs:
(autoload 'html-helper-imenu-setup \"html-helper-imenu\")
(add-hook 'html-helper-mode-hook 'html-helper-imenu-setup)

While this was originaly written for html-helper,
It will work with sgml-mode and others.

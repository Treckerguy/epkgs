 :commentary "\
Emacs's standard method for making buffer names unique adds <2>, <3>,
etc. to the end of (all but one of) the buffers.  This file replaces
that behavior, for buffers visiting files and dired buffers, with a
uniquification that adds parts of the file name until the buffer names
are unique.  For instance, buffers visiting /u/mernst/tmp/Makefile and
/usr/projects/zaphod/Makefile would be named Makefile|tmp and
Makefile|zaphod, respectively (instead of Makefile and Makefile<2>).
Other buffer name styles are also available.

To use this file, do (require 'uniquify)
and set uniquify-buffer-name-style to one of its non-nil alternative values.

For other options, see \"User-visible variables\", below.

A version of uniquify.el that works under Emacs 18, Emacs 19, XEmacs,
and InfoDock is available from the maintainer.")

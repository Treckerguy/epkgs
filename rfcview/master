Introduction:

  For historical reasons, IETF Internet RFCs are required to be in a plain
  ASCII text format that's best-suited for sending directly to a 6-lpi
  US-letter-size printer.  This makes them suboptimal for viewing on-screen,
  as you will be doing for countless hours if you're ever doing network
  programming to one of them.  Fortunately, the ASCII format is usually
  close to what you, the Emacs zealot, *truly* want -- which is a format
  suited to more pleasurably viewing the RFC in Emacs.

  The `rfcview' package uses Emacs overlays to add some fontification and
  hide the page headers and footers (which it replaces with one-line page
  number references that look like \"(p.1)\", right-justified).  The file is
  never modified, and you can see the raw ASCII text by pressing `t'.

System Requirements:

  The `rfcview.el' package was first written using FSF GNU Emacs 20.7 on a
  GNU/Linux system, and is now maintained under Emacs 21.4.  It should work
  with recent Emacs versions on Unix variants.  `rfcview.el' has not yet
  been tested with the XEmacs fork of Emacs, and I'd welcome any necessary
  patches.

Installation:

  1. Put this `rfcview.el' file somewhere in your Emacs Lisp load path.

  2. Add the following lines to your `~/.emacs' file:

         (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist
                      '(\"/\\\\(rfc\\\\|std\\\\)[0-9]+\\\\.txt\\\\'\" . rfcview-mode))

         (autoload 'rfcview-mode \"rfcview\" nil t)

     The next time you visit an RFC file, it should be
     displayed prettily using `rfcview-mode'.  (Do this before turning
     on `auto-compression-mode', so that the `.gz' extension comes before
     `.txt' in `auto-mode-alist'; then compressed RFCs will work too.)

  4. Optionally, do `M-x rfcview-customize RET' to customize the mode
     options.

Things for the Author to Someday Do (but Probably Not):

  * RFC 1700 (STD 2) has unnumbered headings and column-zero body text.  We
    don't try to cope right now, but we might assume, e.g., that lines in
    all-caps with preceding and succeeding blank lines are headings.

  * Hide extraneous blank lines.

  * Handle \"Table of Contents\" heading centered, such as in RFC 1035 and RFC
    1157.

  * Display bibliographic references in other-window
    vertically-sized to fit only the reference (or min window height).

  * Download RFCs on demand, and cache them.  Probably integrate one of the
    existing one or two packages that do this.

  * Make an RFCedit mode.

  * Handle multi-line heading like:

        19.6.1.1 Changes to Simplify Multi-homed Web Servers and Conserve IP
        Addresses

  * Have a stack for (internal) hyperlinks a la Info.

  * Deal with an index (e.g. RFC 3986).")

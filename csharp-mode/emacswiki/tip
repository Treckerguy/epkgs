 :commentary "\
This is a separate mode to implement the C# constructs and
   font-locking. It is based on the java-mode example from cc-mode.

   csharp-mode requires CC Mode 5.30 or later.  It works with
   cc-mode 5.31.3, which is current at this time.

Features:

  - font-lock and indent of C# syntax including:
      all c# keywords and major syntax
      attributes that decorate methods, classes, fields, properties
      enum types
      #if/#endif  #region/#endregion
      instance initializers
      anonymous functions and methods
      verbatim literal strings (those that begin with @)
      generics

  - automagic code-doc generation when you type three slashes.

  - intelligent inserttion of matched pairs of curly braces.

  - sets the compiler regex for next-error, for csc.exe output.")

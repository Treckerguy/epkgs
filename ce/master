 :commentary "\
Copyediting has many facets.  The Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy (SEP) has a number of copyediting tools that are all
individually quite useful.  As it stands, though (at least, at the
time this project began), they are a grab-bag of tools that, as far
as I can tell, are not always applied uniformly.  It would be nice
if there were just one tool that synthesized all the copyediting
tasks, a single tool that could be used to carry out all (or nearly
all) the copyediting tasks that come up when copyediting entries
for the SEP.

This tool is inspired by a number of Emacs utilities: checkdoc,
ediff, and nxhtml-mode lie in the background.

The tool ought to provide a number of services:

  * validation
  * natural language checking (spelling, grammar, usage)
  * checking for adherence to house style

The tool should provide a way for a copyeditor to step through an
entry, accept of reject suggested changes, and, when accepting a
suggested change, to apply it automatically.  Copyediting cannot be
entirely automated, but many things can be done mechanically
(sometimes interactively with a human copyeditor, sometimes
non-interactively).")

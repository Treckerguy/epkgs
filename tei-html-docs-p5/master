A quick but useful hack for TEI-P5 XML documents: it provides a
function that looks up the name of the element before point and
displays the TEI guidelines for that element.

You need to download and unzip the HTML documentation from
http://tei.sf.net -- the filename will look something like
tei-p5-doc-0.1.9.zip

Now set the variable tei-html-docs-p5-dir to the directory with all of
the ref-*.html files you just unzipped, like so:

   (setq tei-html-docs-p5-dir \"~/TEI_P5/\")

If you don't set tei-html-docs-p5-dir, then the on-line version of the
docs on the TEI web-site will be used instead.

If it is installed, the docs will be viewed with emacs-w3m
(http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/), which requires w3m (apt-get w3m or
see http://w3m.sourceforge.net/); if w3m is not available, an
external web browser will be launched.

Then put this package somewhere in your load-path, require it, and
assign the function tei-html-docs-p5-element-at-point to a
key-binding, with lines like these in your .emacs (this example
assumes you use nxml-mode to edit TEI documents):

   (require 'tei-html-docs-p5)
   (define-key nxml-mode-map (kbd \"<M-f11>\") 'tei-html-docs-p5-element-at-point)")

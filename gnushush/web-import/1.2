The Gnus newsreader (at least version 5.8.3) can be a little bit of a
blabbermouth sometimes, needlessly revealing information in your mail
headers that reduces your privacy or puts you at slightly greater risk of
network attacks against your computer's security.

`gnushush.el' is a small package that pressures Gnus into being a little
bit quieter.  To use it, put the following line in your `.emacs' file:

    (require 'gnushush)

There are some options below that you can set.  Just be sure you know what
you're doing, since wrongly setting some of these options can cause problems
for other people.  The defaults settings are pretty benign.

Some later version of Gnus will probably obviate the need for this package,
but isn't it nice that Emacs Lisp lets us so easily modify software using
layered packages, rather than having to wait for some huge canonical package
to be modified?")

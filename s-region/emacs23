Having loaded this code you can set the region by holding down the
shift key and move the cursor to the other end of the region.  The
functionality provided by this code is similar to that provided by
the editors of Borland International's compilers for ms-dos.

Currently, s-region-move may be bound only to events that are vectors
of length one and whose last element is a symbol.  Also, the functions
that are given this kind of overlay should be (interactive \"p\")
functions.

If the following keys are not already bound then...
C-insert is bound to copy-region-as-kill
S-delete is bound to kill-region
S-insert is bound to yank")

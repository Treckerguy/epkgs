Support Interwiki link such as JargonFile:luser for wiki.el without
aktually hacking wiki.el.

This appends `wiki-inter-highlight' to `wiki-highlight-buffer-hook'
such that interlink are highlighted and get their own local keymap,
and it advises `wiki-no-name-p' such that wiki names within the
interlink are not recognized as such.

Customize `wiki-inter-links' to add more magic.

Note that in order to publish, `wiki-inter-link-publish' must be on
`wiki-pub-rules'.  Loading this file puts it there, if you have
customized the rules, however, you will have to add
`wiki-inter-link-publish' manually.")

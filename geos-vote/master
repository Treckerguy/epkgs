This code is only meaningful in conjunction with gnus and GEOS
ballots.  It is invoked with M-x GEOS-vote in the gnus' *Article*
buffer when reading a GEOS ballot.

GEOS (Global Episode Opinion Survey) is a sort of ratings system in
which viewers rank the quality of episodes of television shows and
GEOS summarizes the results.  See <http://www.swd.net.au/geos/> for
more details.

Changelog:

1998-11-07 22:24:19 Tehom
Made GEOS-vote check whether gnus is running and that the current
buffer is named *Article* and complain if it's not.  

1998-11-07 22:19:40 Tehom  
Added a better suggested autoload to the installation instructions.")

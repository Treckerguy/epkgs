 :commentary "\
This is a derived CC mode for the rust language, partly a
copy-and-paste job from
http://cc-mode.sourceforge.net/derived-mode-ex.el

With further modifications by guesswork and looking through the
cc-langs.el file in the CC-mode distribution to get an idea for
the keyword/symbol classes.

Note: The interface used in this file requires CC Mode 5.30 or
later.")

A simple mode for snarfing stock quotes.

To obtain a quote, type `M-x stock-quote', and enter the ticker
symbol.

To watch a quote in the modeline, configure the variable
`stock-quote-in-modeline' with the name of the ticker symbol to
watch.

To change the way that quotes are obtained, write a new function
and add-hook it to `stock-quote-data-functions'.  It will be passed
the ticker name, and should return the price if it can.  The
default method uses the Money Quick Quotes web page, and the W3
package.

If you want Emacs to do certain things when certain conditions are
met, you should configure the triggers and actions variables.  Only
a few predefined triggers are given, but the mechanism is
extensible.  Just add your trigger function to
`stock-quote-trigger-functions'.  It will be given the ticker name
and price (as a floating point value).  If the function returns a
string, representing the reason why the trigger is firing, then the
trigger is considered as having fired, and an action will be
performed.

Actions are functions that have been add-hook'd to
`stock-quote-trigger-functions'.  If the first action to return a
non-nil value is chosen.  They can do anything, and will be passed
the ticker name, the price, and the reason returned by the trigger
function.

And always remember: profit isn't real until its real.")

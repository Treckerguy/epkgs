 :commentary "\
A port of the popular Vim theme Zenburn for Emacs 24, built on top of
the new built-in theme support in Emacs 24. There exists one other version of the
theme by Daniel Brockman. My version was originally based on it,
but it was in such a disarray, that I decided to rewrite it from
scratch in a more maintainable manner (hopefully).

Installation:

  Drop the theme in a folder that is on `custom-theme-load-path'
and enjoy!

Don't forget that the theme requires Emacs 24.

Bugs

None that I'm aware of.

Credits

Jani Nurminen created the original theme for vim on such this port
is based.

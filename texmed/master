Based on: TeXMed - http://www.bioinformatics.org/texmed/
an interface to NCBI PubMed http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, 
that allows you to query PubMed and to store references in BibTeX format. 
by Arne Muller

This mode adds some convenience functions to the w3m-buffers opened
searching on TexMed

How to install:
1). Download this file and put in your emacs's load-path
2). Put the following in your .emacs:
    (require 'TeXMed)
    (global-set-key \"\\C-ct\" 'TeXMed-search)

DEPENDENCIES: 
1). emacs-w3m http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/ 

How to use:
1). Type C-ct to start a query (that's press Control and c together then
    t alone)
2). Presented with the results of the query you have these options:
    a) Type C-cea to export all results to a bibtex-file
    b) Type C-cel to go through results and choose one by one
        + If you do this till the last entry your selection will be 
          exported automatically
        + If you are satisfied before the end abort with C-g an goto 3.)
3). Type C-cee to export a selection
4). To generally include abstracts or article links you can put the
    following into your .emacs:
    (setq  TeXMed-include-abstract t)
    (setq  TeXMed-include-article-id t)
5). To set the folder in which TeXMed results are stored you can put
    (setq TeXMed-bibtex-folder \"~/bibtex/\")
     in your .emacs (the default is your homedir)

Only tested with Gnu-Emacs 23.1.1 on Linux.

This is my very first minor mode for Emacs:
It probabely has many bugs, uses maybe bad elisp
and fails following some of the conventions

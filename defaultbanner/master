 :commentary "\
It is usual when distributing a set of files to give them a
constant header or banner (sometimes with a pleasant
drawing). Some packages do that with some parameters (autoinsert,
auto-template, defaultcontent and others, all in LCD). But very
often, one wants to change the banner and it is a pain to
consistently update all the files of a distribution to reflect
that new banner. This package addresses this point and is
compatible with the defaultcontent.el package.

Whenever a file is visited, its banner is automatically inspected
and updated if needed. A hook is run that knows about the various
possible banners (antichronologically ordered), identifies which
one is used and replace it by the newest possible. When you decide
to change the banner you just add the new one in front of the
possible banners and that's all!

The interactive function db-check-file allows to run the hook even
if not installed. Another function db-check-every-file updates all
the files given in argument. 

To use this package, add to your .emacs (taking care of load-path)
         (require 'defaultbanner)
and it is ready. Then you have to set up the db-banners-alist 
variable to determine which files must be updated wrt which banners.

Demonstration:

(i) load the defaultbanner package 
(ii) visit a file named \"foo.bar\"
	defaultbanner will see that it does not contain any banner
	and will insert \";;; This is a boring banner.\" 
(iii) Move to the \"foo.bar\" buffer
	You can even add some lines before and after the banner but
	do not try to modify it (or at least leave the word banner in it :)
(iv) Do \\M-x db-demo
	This will install a new banner associated to foo.bar and 
	and will visit again the foo.bar file thus forcing the banner
	to be updated. 
(v) Look!
	a single undo will remove the change.")

Use `edi-mode' to edit raw edi files. Here is how to do that:

(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.edi\" . edi-mode))

Or, if you are > Emacs version 21, you can recognize them
like:

(add-to-list 'magic-mode-alist '(\"^ISA\" . edi-mode))

Key Bindings:
  C-c C-r -- convert a single line EDI file to a multi-line
             edi file (Readable)
  C-c C-e -- covert a multi-line edi file to a single line
             edi file (Non-readable)
  C-c C-c -- query for, and count the give edi segment

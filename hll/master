 :commentary "\
This package provides interactive highlighting of lines, useful if
you are viewing lines of data in a buffer with a group of people
and want to refer to specific lines.  The easiest function to start
with is `hll-toggle-line', which toggles whether the current line
is highlighted or not.  There is also `hll-highlight-line' and
`hll-unhighlight-line' which do the obvious.  There is also
`hll-unhighlight-buffer' which turns off hll highlighting for the
entire buffer.

Navigation between highlighted lines is provided; see
`hll-next-highlight' and `hll-prev-highlight'.

To use, place the file in your load-path and add

(require 'hll)

to your ~/.emacs.

This package is most useful with some keybindings.  I use the
following:

(global-set-key (kbd \"C-c h h\") 'hll-toggle-line)
(global-set-key (kbd \"C-c h p\") 'hll-prev-highlight)
(global-set-key (kbd \"C-c h n\") 'hll-next-highlight)
(global-set-key (kbd \"C-c h u\") 'hll-unhighlight-buffer)

Note:  this package probably only works on GNU Emacs.  Untested on
XEmacs, patches accepted.")

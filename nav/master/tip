 :commentary "\
To use this file, put something like the following in your
~/.emacs:

(add-to-list 'load-path \"/directory/containing/nav/\")
(require 'nav)

Type M-x nav to open the navigation window. It should show up as a
narrow column on the left, showing the contents of the current
directory. If there are multiple windows open, all but one will be
closed to make sure the nav window shows up correctly.

Key Bindings

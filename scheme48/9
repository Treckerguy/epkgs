This file provides `scheme48-mode', a major mode for improved
interaction with Scheme48. It's the same as the canonical
`scheme-mode', but provides some commands which tell Scheme48 from
which a specific definition came from. This allows Scheme48 to put
the definition in the correct package by itself.

This is based om the cmuscheme48.el which comes with Scheme48.

You can set a buffer-local variable named `scheme48-package' to
send definitions to that package. This can be done by file
variables, so the following works:

  -*- mode: scheme48; scheme48-package: mypackage -*-

To use the special packages CONFIG, USER and EXEC, use the package
name in parens, like this:

  -*- mode: scheme48; scheme48-package: (exec) -*-")

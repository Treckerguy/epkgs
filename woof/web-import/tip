The problem:
You work on different computers and you want to send files or
the selected text to other hosts.

The solution:
woof (Web Offer One File): http://www.home.unix-ag.org/simon/woof.html
woof is a small webserver that serves a given file
you can download the file on a different host from this webserver

woof.el integrates the woof script in your emacs work-flow:
You can easily provide a file to download (M-x woof-provide-file)
And it is also easy to receive such a file on a different host
(M-x woof-receive or C-u M-x woof-receive)

woof.el needs the woof script from:
http://www.home.unix-ag.org/simon/woof

woof.el also needs wget
It should work on GNU/Linux systems, I have also added some hacks to make it work on cygwin.

The latest version of woof.el can be found at:
http://www.xsteve.at/prg/emacs/

Usage:
put the following in your .emacs:
(require 'woof)

(woof-set-download-url-list '(\"http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080\" \"http://yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy:8080\"
                              (\"nice-name\" \"http://zzz.zzz.zzz.zzz:8080\")))
(global-set-key [<your key here>] 'woof-provide-dwim)
(global-set-key [<your key here>] 'woof-receive)

If you are using cygwin, you probably need the following also:
(setq woof-cygwin-bin-path \"c:/cygwin/bin\")
(setq woof-wget-cmd \"c:/cygwin/bin/wget\")
(setq woof-cmd \"c:/cygwin/usr/local/bin/woof\")

Woof is also available via the Tools menu

Please contact me, if you find woof.el useful, or if you have ideas for improvements.")

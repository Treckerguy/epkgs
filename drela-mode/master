 :commentary "\
This is a major mode for editing files used in Drela's aerodynamic
codes.  The mode supports syntax highlighting, easy tabbing through
and indentation of data elements, plotting of geometries, and running
AVL within EMACS.  This version is still a work-in-progress and only 
supports AVL and a little ASWING.  

AVL functions:
C-p        Plots the geometry of the current AVL file
C-e        Executes AVL on the current AVL file
C-RET      Inserts a \"standard\" comment
C-Sh-RET   Removes the preceding comment
Tab        Moves to next element/indents elements
Sh-Tab     Moves to previous element

ASWING functions:
Tab        Moves to next element/indents elements
Sh-Tab     Moves to previous element")

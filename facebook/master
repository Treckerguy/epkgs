 :commentary "\
First pass at interfacing with facebook.  You must add the \"developers 
  app\" and get your own application api-key and application secret key to 
  use this.  Also, facebook's authentication scheme is, well, ridiculous, 
  so you've got to have gnutls or openssl installed, as well as a working
  browser that handles https to log in and give your app permissions.
  Also, it requires hober's excellent json.el which can be obtained here:
  http://edward.oconnor.cx/elisp/json.el

  To log into facebook, call (facebook-login)
  To check credentials/optionally login call (facebook-check-creds)
  To make api calls call (facebook-call-function \"<funcname>\" (list (cons \"of\" \"args\") (cons \"more\" \"args\")))

  Only two actual api functions are present right now, (though you can 
  use facebook-call-function to call whatever you'd like...):
  facebook-users-has-app-permission = users.hasAppPermission
  facebook-users-set-status = users.setStatus
  facbeook-users-set-status checks for the applicable app permission 
  redirects the user to the permission page if needed and then goes and 
  updates the status.

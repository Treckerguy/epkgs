 :commentary "\
I became tired of mc-sign signing mails that I had already encrypted.  This
is just some lisp magic to *only* sign if I haven't encrypted.  This also
caused some problems with mailers that required passphrases to be entered
twice, once on verifying the signature and again when decrypting.

This should be added to the mailcrypt distribution IMO.")

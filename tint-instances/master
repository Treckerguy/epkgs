This emacs script takes the word where point is currently on and tints
all instances of this word in the current buffer.
If the region is active, it is taken as the current word to be tinted.


Quickstart Installation:
========================

To get this to work, make emacs execute the line

(require 'tint-instances)                    ;; load the package

I would also recommend executing the following commands
so as to extend the bindings in your global keymap:

(define-key global-map \"\\M-c\" 'tint_all_instances_of_current_word)
(define-key global-map \"\\M-v\" 'untint_all_instances_of_current_word)

If there are problems with the colors used, change the entries in the
color_array to your favourite colors (you can list all available colors
of your installation by the command \"M-x list-colors-display\")")

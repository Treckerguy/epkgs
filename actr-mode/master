 :commentary "\
This code is a very much extended version of the lisp-mode that comes
standard with emacs. 

Part of the ACT-R support library for Emacs. Main file is actr-mode.el.
Browse the code or see the web-page
http://www.van-rijn.org/actr-mode for more information.

This code is tested with GNU Emacs 21.3.50.4.

How to install [on Unix]:

Copy the files actr-mode.el in a directory that is
part of the load-path variable. If you don't know about such a directory,
create a directory (for example named \"~/emacs-lisp\"), copy the files in
that directory, and add the following line to your \".emacs\":

 (setq load-path (append '(\"~/emacs-lisp\") load-path))

If that's done, add the following line after the redefinition of
load-path:

 (require 'actr-mode)

After opening a file that ends in either .actr or .act, actr-mode should be 
enabled automatically, giving you syntax highlighting etc.

(Highlights of) History: 

030729 - 2

- Updated for ACT-R 5. 
- Updated contact information.
- Smart tab now works when line starts with negation 
- Removed outline support, wasn't using it.
- Removed lots of other code and info, don't have the time to update things 
  that I do not use.
- Removed all pretty print code, as it was to difficult to quickly get that 
  running again for ACT-R 5. Probably won't be too difficult to get it running
  using calls to actr-smart-tab. 

Known bugs:

- pressing tab when point is on the same line but after a closing parenthesis of 
  a prule indents the parenthesis incorrectly.

981118 - 1.12

Improved syntax highlighting. \"isa\" and \"chunk-type\" are better
highlighted now.

980930 - 1.9

Changed actr-smart-tab to indent lisp code inside an prule correctly.

980930 - 1.6

Improved magic-minus behaviour. Pressing \"-\" only does its magic when
it's the first character on a line.

980930 - 1.5

Added outline support. Still somewhat rough, all \"(\"s at the column 0 are
seen as the start of a new outline entry. Should be able to be somewhat
more intelligent.

980929 - 1.2

First public version")

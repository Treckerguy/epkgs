 :commentary "\
TAL is Tandem's Transaction Application Language.
pTAL is the newer 'portable' version of the language.

Keywords as of G06.05 are recognized by this version of tal-mode.
TAL words not supported in pTAL are highlighted with a warning face.

Both ! and -- style comments are handled correctly (I think).

Movement by balanced expressions is supported.  That is, begin/end pairs
  are recognized.

imenu recognizes ?section <name>, ?page <name> and <type> PROC <name>.")

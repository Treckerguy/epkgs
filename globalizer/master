Scan through a buffer to find strings eligible for translation. 
Allow user to observe changes and make an educated choice: approve, veto,
quit or make changes automatically. Basically it does everything
query-replace does, but calls user-defined hook when replace
actually happens.

In other words if you choose the string to be translatable, it will
add .t to it (make it globalized) and also add the string to
another buffer which you can later give to a native translator to
create actual translations.")

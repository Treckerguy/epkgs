This package allows to hand over a buffer to be sent off
via the system's designated e-mail client.
Note that the e-mail client will display the contents of the buffer
again for editing.
The e-mail client is taken to be whoever handles a mailto: URL
via `browse-url'.
Mailto: URLs are composed according to RFC2368.

MIME bodies are not supported - we rather expect the mail client
to encode the body and add, for example, a digital signature.
The mailto URL RFC calls for \"short text messages that are
actually the content of automatic processing.\"
So mailclient.el is ideal for situations where an e-mail is
generated automatically, and the user can edit it in the
mail client (e.g. bug-reports).

To activate:
(setq send-mail-function 'mailclient-send-it) ; if you use `mail'")

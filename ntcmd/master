 :commentary "\
This is a mode for highlighting and indenting Windows cmd scripts.
It uses a parser in several passes to ensure the buffer is
interpreted the way that cmd would see it. It also features
electric indentation.

The default fontification of variable references is basic, but
there are several faces that can be adjusted to suit your fancy.")

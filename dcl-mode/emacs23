DCL mode is a package for editing DCL command files.  It helps you
indent lines, add leading `$' and trailing `-', move around in the
code and insert lexical functions.

Type `C-h m' when you are editing a .COM file to get more
information about this mode.

To use templates you will need a version of tempo.el that is at
least later than the buggy 1.1.1, which was included with my versions of
Emacs.  I used version 1.2.4.
The latest tempo.el distribution can be fetched from
ftp.lysator.liu.se in the directory /pub/emacs.
I recommend setting (setq tempo-interactive t).  This will make
tempo prompt you for values to put in the blank spots in the templates.

There is limited support for imenu.  The limitation is that you need
a version of imenu.el that uses imenu-generic-expression.  I found
the version I use in Emacs 19.30.  (It was *so* much easier to hook
into that version than the one in 19.27...)

Any feedback will be welcomed.  If you write functions for
dcl-calc-command-indent-function or dcl-calc-cont-indent-function,
please send them to the maintainer.


Ideas for improvement:
* Better font-lock support.
* Change meaning of `left margin' when dcl-tab-always-indent is nil.
  Consider the following line (`_' is the cursor):
    $ label: _ command
  Pressing tab with the cursor at the underline now inserts a tab.
  This should be part of the left margin and pressing tab should indent
  the line.
* Make M-LFD work properly with comments in all cases.  Now it only
  works on comment-only lines.  But what is \"properly\"? New rules for
  indenting comments?
* Even smarter indentation of continuation lines.
* A delete-indentation function (M-^) that joins continued lines,
  including lines with end line comments?
* Handle DECK/EOD.
* `indent list' commands: C-M-q, C-u TAB.  What is a list in DCL? One
  complete command line? A block? A subroutine?")

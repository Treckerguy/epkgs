 :commentary "\
This mode is intended to be used for telnet or rsh to a remote host;
`telnet' and `rsh' are the two entry points.  Multiple telnet or rsh
sessions are supported.

Normally, input is sent to the remote telnet/rsh line-by-line, as you
type RET or LFD.  C-c C-c sends a C-c to the remote immediately;
C-c C-z sends C-z immediately.  C-c C-q followed by any character
sends that character immediately.

All RET characters are filtered out of the output coming back from the
remote system.  The mode tries to do other useful translations based
on what it sees coming back from the other system before the password
query.  It knows about UNIX, ITS, TOPS-20 and Explorer systems.

You can use the global telnet-host-properties to associate a telnet
program and login name with each host you regularly telnet to.")

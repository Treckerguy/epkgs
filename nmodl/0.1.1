 :commentary "\
This major mode for GNU Emacs provides support for editing Neuron NMODL
dot-mod files.  It automatically indents for block structures and
comments.  It highlights code using font-lock.

Finding Updates:

The latest stable version of nmodl.el can be found here:

http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/~dcs/progs/neuron/nmodl.el

To use nmodl.el, you also need to have downloaded and installed 
nrnhoc.el . It can be found at

http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/~dcs/progs/neuron/nrnhoc.el

Installation:

  Make sure you have obtain and installed nrnhoc.el
  
  Put the this file as \"nmodl.el\" somewhere on your load path, then
  add this to your .emacs or init.el file:

  (autoload 'nmodl-mode \"nmodl\" \"Enter NMODL mode.\" t)
  (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '(\"\\\\.mod\\\\'\" . nmodl-mode) auto-mode-alist))

Please read the mode help for nmodl-mode for configuration options.

Syntax highlighting:
  To get font-lock try adding this for older emacsen:
    (font-lock-mode 1)
  Or for newer versions of Emacs:
    (global-font-lock-mode t)
  In Xemacs the following seems to work
    (add-hook 'nmodl-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)


This package will optionally use custom.")

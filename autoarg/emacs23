This provides `autoarg-mode', a global minor mode meant to emulate
a facility reported from Twenex Emacs whereby digit keys supplied
prefix args rather than self inserting, with a digit sequence
terminated by space acting to insert the digits.

The bindings of DIGIT and C-DIGIT are swapped and a command bound
to SPC deals with a numeric prefix arg or acts normally without
such an arg.  (In the absence of a suitable terminal, you'd
probably want to swap DIGIT and M-DIGIT.)  See the mode doc.

You probably don't really want to use this.

Also provides `autoarg-kp-mode' which is similar, but leaves the
digit keys alone and redefines the `keypad' keys, `kp-1' &c as
digit arguments.  (Use `NumLock' if necessary to generate kp-N.)
You're more likely to want to use this.")

 :commentary "\
When hitting M-x there is a bazillion of commands to choose from.
With jcl-define-command-subset one can create a command that works
like M-x but the completion only consider a subset of available
commands.  Which commands are part of that subset is determined by
a regex passed to jcl-define-command-subset.

Example usage:

;; Define a subset with all commands that starts with \"jcl-\".
(jcl-define-command-subset jcl-command-subset \"M-z \" \"^jcl-\" \"jcl-\")

;; Define a subset with all commands which have the string \"toggle\"
;; in their name.
(jcl-define-command-subset jcl-toggle-command-subset \"M-Z \" \"toggle\")

;; Define a subset with all monkey related commands.
(jcl-define-command-subset jcl-monkey-command-subset
                           \"Select monkey business: \"
                           \"monkey\\\\|ape\\\\|chimp\\\\|gorilla\")

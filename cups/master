If you have cups on your *nix machine, this script will read your
conf file (usually \"/etc/cups/printers.conf\") and allow you to
change your default printer to any one, via the included
\"choose-printer\" command. This has tab completion of printer names,
so it's useful if you have a lot of printers -- I use it mainly
prior to using the dvips command in AUCTeX, but it's also useful
for quick printing of plain text.

This also has an optional menu entry. It's on by default,
but you can turn it off in your .emacs. See below. 

UPDATE: I've now added a simple cache (set as ~/.emacs-cups-cache),
which just saves the printer list if the cups conf file hasn't
changed. This means that this should only slow down your startup
(*if* it slows down your startup) when you change your cups
settings.

To use, put the following in your ~/.emacs:

(setq printer-conf-file \"/path/to/cups/printers.conf\") (setq
cups-printer-menu t) ;set to `nil' if you don't want menus.
(load-file \"/path/to/this/cups.el\")

If you use Ubuntu (and maybe some other distributions) you
will find that it wants to make the printers.conf file only
readable by root after every change. (It's in the lp group,
but that is only given execute permission.) One suolution is
to just make the printer.conf file readable:
		
		chmod +r ;; /etc/cups/printers.conf 

	If you don't want to do this... well, I'd be
	happy to hear any other suggestions.

Finally, just run M-x choose-printer.

v0.1 - 30 0ct 2005 
   * First version 

v0.2 - 15 Nov 2005 - 
   * Added radio buttons to the menu.
   * Cleaned up the menu code
   * Added a cache file so it won't slow down startup more than
     once.")

mv-shell integrates with shell-mode in order to keep buffers in sync when
moving files around.  If you enter a 'mv' command on a file that has a buffer opened,
the buffer is also renamed and moved to the location the file is moved to.  Buffers are
also moved when a directory they are in is moved.

Installation:

To install, put this file somewhere in your load-path and add the following
to your .emacs file:

(require 'mv-shell)
(mv-shell-mode 1)")

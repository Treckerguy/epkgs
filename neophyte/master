I created this mode to address a concern that emacs was \"*very
hard*\" to learn and use.  I personally think *very hard* is an
exaggeration, but there is a perception that emacs makes no
concessions to a novice user.  I created this mode to make things
easier.

First, it pops up a quick key reference buffer.  This will help
people access the tutorial and tell them how to quit, always a
tough thing for a new user.  Second, it will redefine M-x to show
the key (if any) a command is bound to as you use it.  Lastly, it
does some terminal specific things to make things nicer.  Under X,
we set up s-region and transient-mark mode.  Under ttys, we set up
tmm-menubar to make the menus accessible to users.

It also makes use of the Helper functions to make (most) help
functions more useful.

This code is not finished and I would like any comments on making
emacs easier to learn.  I want to help people learn emacs, so
suggestions like remapping all the keys and eliminating all buffer
changing commands will fall on deaf ears.

The latest version of this code is available from
ftp://hubert.wustl.edu/pub/elisp .

TODO
* Make it easier for novice to make menus
* help buffer ala Jed, but context sensitive
* Configuration package
* AI-like tips during work
* Change to using advice

For release 2.x:
* Start neophyte-configurator.  Support font-lock and common hooks.

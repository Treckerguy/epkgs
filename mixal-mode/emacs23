 :commentary "\
Major mode for the mix asm language.
The mix asm language is described in \"The Art Of Computer Programming\".

For optimal use, also use GNU MDK.  Compiling needs mixasm, running
and debugging needs mixvm and mixvm.el from GNU MDK.  You can get
GNU MDK from `https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/mdk/' and
`ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/mdk'.

To use this mode, place the following in your .emacs file:
`(load-file \"/PATH-TO-FILE/mixal-mode.el\")'.
When you load a file with the extension .mixal the mode will be started
automatic.  If you want to start the mode manual, use `M-x mixal-mode'.
Font locking will work, the behavior of tabs is the same as Emacs's
default behavior.  You can compile a source file with `C-c c' you can
run a compiled file with `C-c r' or run it in debug mode with `C-c d'.
You can get more information about a particular operation code by using
mixal-describe-operation-code or `C-h o'.

Have fun.")

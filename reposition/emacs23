Reposition-window makes an entire function definition or comment visible,
or, if it is already visible, places it at the top of the window;
additional invocations toggle the visibility of comments preceding the
code.  For the gory details, see the documentation for reposition-window;
rather than reading that, you may just want to play with it.

This tries pretty hard to do the recentering correctly; the precise
action depends on what the buffer looks like.  If you find a situation
where it doesn't behave well, let me know.  This function is modeled
after one of the same name in ZMACS, but the code is all-new and the
behavior in some situations differs.")

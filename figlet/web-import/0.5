 :commentary "\
To use this feature simple eval (require 'figlet) type M-x figlet
and you will be asked for a string. If you use a prefix (C-u M-x
figlet) then you will be asked for a font.

Have a look at `figlet-comment', `figlet-figletify-region' and
`figlet-figletify-region-comment'.

Warning, leaving large ascii art text in your teams codebase might
cause an outbreak of physical violence.")

There is at present support for GNU/Linux, OS X and Windows.  This
library supports both the `/proc/apm' file format of Linux version
1.3.58 or newer and the `/proc/acpi/' directory structure of Linux
2.4.20 and 2.6.  Darwin (OS X) is supported by using the `pmset'
program.  Windows is supported by the GetSystemPowerStatus API call.")

The functions understand all integers, including negative ones.
Provided is a way to interactively increment or decrement an
integer under a point or within a region.  Integers are
understood to be of the form \"-?[0-9]+\"; the positive symbol is
ignored (for better or worse).

To make available from a keyboard command put something like the
following in your ~/.emacs:

(global-set-key [M-up] 'integer-increment-integer-at-point)
(global-set-key [M-down] 'integer-decrement-integer-at-point)")

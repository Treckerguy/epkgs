 :commentary "\
Major mode for viewing/editing RTF source.  I wrote this mostly for
the sake of syntax-highlighting, and for the {}-matching.  It offers
little else in the way of conveniences (like key shortcuts.)
(If are interested in such conveniences, email me.)

I maintain a homepage for this mode, at http://interglacial.com/rtf/emacs/

Note that this mode doesn't (yet?) specially handle Help-RTF constructs.

Also note that at time of writing (Oct 2006), Xemacs doesn't seem to
support some of the functions that this mode requires.  Sorry, Xemacs users!

As with many programming modes, the default wrapping mechinisms
(whether via auto-fill-mode, or via fill-paragraph etc commands) do
not behave at all well.  So I've disabled wrapping as best I can,
so you don't end up corrupting documents.  Moreover, implementing
wrapping in RTF seems fairly difficult because of how spaces are
sometimes a significant token in RTF whereas newlines are not.

For more on RTF, see http://interglacial.com/rtf/ and also be a chum and
go get this little book I wrote:  http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596004753

 :commentary "\
For several years there has been a command `what-domain' defined in
mail-extr.el, which is shipped with Emacs.  But it has several
limitations:

    * It's not up to date in older versions of emacs
    * Only resolves 2-letter country codes into domain names
    * Not callable from lisp because it always writes to the echo area

This package provides the following commands:

    * what-domain-a2       (`what-domain' is aliased to this)
    * what-domain-a3       (lets you query 3-letter country codes)
    * what-domain-num      (lets you query numeric country codes)
    * what-domain-apropos  (lets you search for domain codes by name)

Each of which returns a useful list of information when called from
lisp, and allows you to perform interactive searches in different ways.

Most of the country codes come from the RIPE Network Coordination
Centre's tracking of ISO 3166, last updated 1997-08-07 15:59:51 UTC")

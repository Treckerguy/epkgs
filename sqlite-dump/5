 :commentary "\
This spot of code runs the sqlite3 program to .dump a database file as
SQL text for viewing and editing.  Use `sqlite-dump' in `auto-mode-alist'
to automatically visit desired files this way.

The `buffer-file-format' mechanism is used with a dump for decode and
running the SQL to re-write.  See the `sqlite-dump' docstring for
details.")

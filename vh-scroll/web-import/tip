This file contains changes by Noah Friedman.
Based on original author's version 1.0 of 1993-11-18

 This file, when loaded, affects mainly three things:

 * If lines are truncated, the window is automatically scrolled
   horizontally when the point has moved out to the left or right.
   The already existing variable `hscroll-step' is used to control
   how big steps the window are scrolled. If this variable is set
   to nil, auto-scrolling is disabled. The variable
   `vh-max-empty-visible' controls how much space may be scrolled
   in after the end of the current line.

 * The horizontal scrolling commands `vh-scroll-right' and
   `vh-scroll-left' drags the point after them.

 * The vertical scrolling commands `vh-scroll-down' and
   `vh-scroll-up' tries to keep the point in the same column, using
   `goal-column' and `temporary-goal-column' as appropriate. They
   can be intermixed with `next-line' and `previous-line' without
   loosing the temporary goal column. If `vh-track-goal-column' is
   non-nil, then auto-scrolling tries to keep the (temporary) goal
   column in sight rather than the point.

 Also defined is the function `vh-scroll-to-point' which tries to
 recenter the point horizontally, and the function
 `toggle-truncate-lines' which does what it sounds like.

 NOTE: At the end of this file are some variable settings and key
 bindings which you might rather want to move out to your .emacs
 and change to something else.

 NOTE AGAIN: Not to loose the temporary goal column when scrolling with
 `vh-scroll-down' and `vh-scroll-up' is intermixed with `next-line' and
 `previous-line', this file advises the function `line-move'.")

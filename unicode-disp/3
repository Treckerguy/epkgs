 :commentary "\
M-x unicode-disp changes the display table to show selected unicode chars
as ascii equivalents or near equivalents.  The chars affected are a
personal selection of the worst bits of unicode encountered, just with
the aim of making them displayable on an ascii or latin1 tty.  If nothing
else it might give you ideas for display table mangling of your own.")

 :commentary "\
M-x unicode-disp changes the display table to show selected unicode chars
as ascii equivalents or near equivalents.  The chars affected are a
personal selection of the worst bits of unicode encountered, just with
the aim of making them displayable on an ascii or latin1 tty.  If nothing
else it might give you ideas for display table mangling of your own.

See latin1-disp.el for similar display table setups for otherwise
undisplayable characters from the iso-8859-N charsets, and some cyrillic.

Quite how much you want to transform and how prominent you want it is a
matter of personal preference.  Displaying a char as a sequence like \"->\"
can make text lines come out too long, or tables etc not align, sometimes
very badly.  A face like `escape-glyph' can make it clear you're looking
at non-ascii, except it becomes very distracting if the screen is
littered with it.

The variant hyphens and quotes currently treated by `unicode-disp' are
considered fairly pointless and may as well display as plain ascii \"-\" as
necessary, with no special highlighting.")

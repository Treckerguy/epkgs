This code sets up human-readable decode of XTide .tcd tide constituent
database files using the `buffer-file-format' mechanism and the
restore_tide_db program from XTide tcd-utils,

It's only meant for browsing tcd files if you don't have the source
handy.  There's no support for re-writing a .tcd file.

This mode uses the Keywords library header to provide code-finding
services by keyword.

Things to do:
   1. Support multiple keywords per search.  This could be extremely hairy;
there doesn't seem to be any way to get completing-read to exit on
an EOL with no substring pending, which is what we'd want to end the loop.
   2. Search by string in synopsis line?
   3. Function to check finder-package-info for unknown keywords.")

 :commentary "\
To enter tie-mode automatically, add (autoload 'tie-mode \"tie-mode\")
to your .emacs file and add something like,

(setq auto-mode-alist (append (list (cons \"\\\\.tie\\\\'\" 'tie-mode))
                              auto-mode-alist))

to your .emacs file; otherwise the .pl suffix defaults to prolog-mode.

This code is based on the 20.7 version perl-mode.el, with extensive
rewriting.

The rest of the commentary was in the original perl-mode.el

I added a new feature which adds functionality to TAB; it is controlled
by the variable tie-tab-to-comment.  With it enabled, TAB does the
first thing it can from the following list:  change the indentation;
move past leading white space; delete an empty comment; reindent a
comment; move to end of line; create an empty comment; tell you that
the line ends in a quoted string, or has a # which should be a \\#.

If your machine is slow, you may want to remove some of the bindings
to electric-tie-terminator.  I changed the indenting defaults to be
what Larry Wall uses in tie/lib, but left in all the options.

I also tuned a few things:  comments and labels starting in column
zero are left there by indent-tie-exp; tie-beginning-of-function
goes back to the first open brace/paren in column zero, the open brace
in 'sub ... {', or the equal sign in 'format ... ='; indent-tie-exp
(meta-^q) indents from the current line through the close of the next
brace/paren, so you don't need to start exactly at a brace or paren.

It may be good style to put a set of redundant braces around your
main program.  This will let you reindent it with meta-^q.

Known problems (these are all caused by limitations in the Emacs Lisp
parsing routine (parse-partial-sexp), which was not designed for such
a rich language; writing a more suitable parser would be a big job):
1)  Regular expression delimiters do not act as quotes, so special
      characters such as `'\"#:;[](){} may need to be backslashed
      in regular expressions and in both parts of s/// and tr///.
2)  The globbing syntax <pattern> is not recognized, so special
      characters in the pattern string must be backslashed.
3)  The q, qq, and << quoting operators are not recognized; see below.
4)  \\ (backslash) always quotes the next character, so '\\' is
      treated as the start of a string.  Use \"\\\\\" as a work-around.
5)  To make variables such a $' and $#array work, tie-mode treats
      $ just like backslash, so '$' is the same as problem 5.
6)  Unfortunately, treating $ like \\ makes ${var} be treated as an
      unmatched }.  See below.
7)  When ' (quote) is used as a package name separator, tie-mode
      doesn't understand, and thinks it is seeing a quoted string.

Here are some ugly tricks to bypass some of these problems:  the tie
expression /`/ (that's a back-tick) usually evaluates harmlessly,
but will trick tie-mode into starting a quoted string, which
can be ended with another /`/.  Assuming you have no embedded
back-ticks, this can used to help solve problem 3:

    /`/; $ugly = q?\"'$?; /`/;

To solve problem 6, add a /{/; before each use of ${var}:
    /{/; while (<${glob_me}>) ...

Problem 7 is even worse, but this 'fix' does work :-(

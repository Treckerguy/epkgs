Some packages ship with broken implementations of `format-spec';
for example, stable versions of TRAMP and ERC do this.  To fix
this, you can put the following at the end of your ~/.emacs:

  (unless (zenash-format-spec-works-p)
    (zenash-define-format-spec))

Thanks to Jani Nurminen, who created the original zenburn color
theme for vim.  I'm just copying him. :-)

Short-Term Wishlist:

Theme the ansi-term faces `term-red', etc., and the ERC faces
`fg:erc-color-face1', etc.

Theme `gnus-server-offline-face', `gnus-server-opened-face', and
`gnus-server-denied-face'.  First, find out what they hell they do.

Theme `gnus-emphasis-highlight-words' after finding out what it
does.

Theme `emms-stream-name-face' and `emms-stream-url-face'.

Theme `ido-indicator-face'.")

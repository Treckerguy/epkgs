 :commentary "\
This package does two things.  First, it extends Magit's UI with
assorted GitHub-related functionality, similar to the github-gem
tool (http://github.com/defunkt/github-gem).  Second, it uses
Magit's excellent Git library to build an Elisp library for
interfacing with GitHub's API.")

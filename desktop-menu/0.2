This packages provides a Desktop Menu for managing different Emacs desktops
in a directory.

Start menu with
M-x desktop-menu

Use key ? for help in Desktop Menu.

Why a Desktop Menu?
The Emacs package `desktop' is a really nice menu for saving and reading
various Emacs desktops in different directories.
But often I have the problems:
- I want to save various Emacs desktops in the same directory and
- I lost the overview for directories with a Emacs desktop.
So I've developed a menu which handles various Emacs desktops
in one directory and I can give each desktop a nice name.

Customization:

There is an customization group called desktop-menu in group desktop
Start customization by M-x `desktop-menu-customize'")

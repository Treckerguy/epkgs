Define filesets, which can be opened or saved with the power of one or
two mouse clicks only.  A fileset is either a list of files, a file
pattern, a base directory and a search pattern (for files), or an
inclusion group (i.e. a base file including other files).

Usage: 1. Put

   (require 'filesets)
   (filesets-init)

into your start-up file.  2. Type M-x filesets-edit or choose \"Edit
Filesets\" from the menu.  3. Save your customizations.

Caveat: Fileset names have to be unique.

Filesets.el adds a nifty filesets menu to your menubar.  If you change
your filesets on the fly, don't forget to select \"Save Filesets\" from
the menu.

Pressing on the first item in the submenu will open all files at once.
Define your own function, e.g. browse-url, for opening a fileset's
files.  Or define external viewers for opening files with other
programs.  See `filesets-external-viewers'.

BTW, if you close a fileset, files, which have been changed, will
be silently saved.  Change this behaviour by setting
`filesets-save-buffer-function'.

Supported modes for inclusion groups (`filesets-ingroup-patterns'):
- Elisp
- Emacs-Wiki (simple names only)
- LaTeX")

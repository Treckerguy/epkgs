 :commentary "\
`winhist-mode' is a global mode that records every change to the
window configuration in a \"ring\" (like the yank ring or the mark
ring).  It is then possible to step backward and forward through
the history of window configurations.  I find this to be valuable
for restoring mental context when working on a complex project.

This works imperfectly because of vagaries in the way buffers and
windows are connected and manipulated by various packages.  In
particular, sometimes several consecutive window configurations in
the history may seem to be identical.  But it's better than
nothing, and I also like it better than some packages that require
you to remember to save and possibly name a window configuration
before restoring it.

To use this package, add
 (require 'winhist)
 (winhist-mode 1)
to your .emacs.  You should then bind keysequences to the commands
`winhist-backward' and `winhist-forward'.  I prefer:
 (global-set-key \"\\M-B\" 'winhist-backward)
 (global-set-key \"\\M-F\" 'winhist-forward)")

This is Sebastian Kremer's excellent dired-x.el (Dired Extra), version
1.191, hacked up for GNU Emacs.  Redundant or conflicting material has
been removed or renamed in order to work properly with dired of GNU
Emacs.  All suggestions or comments are most welcomed.


Please, PLEASE, *PLEASE* see the info pages.


BUGS: Type M-x dired-x-submit-report and a report will be generated.

INSTALLATION: In your ~/.emacs,

(add-hook 'dired-load-hook
          (function (lambda ()
                      (load \"dired-x\")
                      ;; Set global variables here.  For example:
                      ;; (setq dired-guess-shell-gnutar \"gtar\")
                      )))
(add-hook 'dired-mode-hook
          (function (lambda ()
                      ;; Set buffer-local variables here.  For example:
                      ;; (dired-omit-mode 1)
                      )))

At load time dired-x.el will install itself, redefine some functions, and
bind some dired keys.  *Please* see the info pages for more details.

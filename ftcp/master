 :commentary "\
In Emacs 19.30 and prior, emacs can hang indefinitely during a call to
open-network-stream if the remote host is down, because it must wait for
the `connect' system call to time out; there is no way to interrupt it.
In Emacs 19.31 this call was made interruptable, but this package is
still useful for making proxy connections through firewalls using
kerberos or ssh, for example.

This package redefines `open-network-stream' so that you can toggle
between using an external program to handle TCP connection and I/O, or
use emacs' internal support (if available).

The Emacs distribution comes with a program called `tcp' in the lib-src
directory.  Normally it is not compiled or installed, so it is not used
here by default.  Another similar program is `nc' (\"netcat\") which is
available as an RPM for Red Hat systems.

Another alternative is my `tcpconnect' program, available via
ftp://ftp.splode.com/pub/users/friedman/scripts/tcpconnect or you can
write to me by email and ask for a copy.  `tcpconnect' is available
under the same legal conditions as this program.")

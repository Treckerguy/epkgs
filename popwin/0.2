Popwin makes you free from the hell of annoying buffers such like
*Help*, *Completions*, *compilation*, and etc.

To use popwin, just add the following code into your .emacs:

    (require 'popwin)
    (setq display-buffer-function 'popwin:display-buffer)

Then try to show some buffer, for example *Help* or
*Completeions*. Unlike standard behavior, their buffers may be
shown in a popup window at the bottom of the frame. And you can
close the popup window seamlessly by typing C-g or selecting other
windows.

`popwin:display-buffer' displays special buffers in a popup window
and displays normal buffers as unsual. Special buffers are
specified in `popwin:special-display-config', which tells popwin
how to display such buffers. See docstring of
`popwin:special-display-config' for more information.

Instead of a recommended way, you can also use popwin by setting
`special-display-function' like:

    (require 'popwin)
    (setq special-display-function
          'popwin:special-display-popup-window)

In this case, you need to change `special-display-buffer-names' or
`special-display-regexps' so that popwin takes care of such
buffers.

The default width/height/position of popup window can be changed by
setting `popwin:popup-window-width', `popwin:popup-window-height',
and `popwin:popup-window-position'.  You can also change the
behavior for a specific buffer. See docstring of
`popwin:special-display-config'.")

Owes a lot in initial idea to the emacs video editor gneve
(http://www.1010.co.uk/gneve.html).  This mode controls mplayer
directly, using its slave-mode (see
http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/tech/slave.txt), which accepts
commands on stdin.  The original motivation was to facilitate note
taking from videos; hence it is possible to pause, skip backwards
and forwards, and insert a timestamp of the current position.")

This file contains a number of extensions to dired.
 1. The delete command can delete a non-empty directory by deleting
    all its files and subdirectories.
 2. The copy command can copy a directory by copying a directory and
    all its files and subdirectories.
 3. Handle archives (tar, arc, lharc, zoo etc.). This is not a replacement
    for tar-mode or archive-mode but it complements them. There are commands
    unpacking an entire archive, extracting specified files (it might be
    better to use tar-mode etc. for this) and get a content listing.
    Furthermore the copy command is extended to copy marked files to a
    target that is an archive.
 4. View files with a method depending on file name.
 5. Print files with a method depending on file name.
 6. Remove carriage return at end of lines for marked files.
 7. Toggle case for file base name (excluding the extension).

 If you only want some of these extensions, it is fairly easy to lift out
 the code you want. The first page contains some support functions, the
 other pages are all independent of each other. ;;;; is used to delimit
 pages instead of page-marks to avoid possible problems in mail.")

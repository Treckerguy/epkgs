 :commentary "\
M-x perl-pod-preview displays a preview of Perl POD format documentation
using \"pod2man\" and \"man\".  It can show pod inlined in perl code or in a
separate pod file.

The best feature is that when re-previewing the same file or buffer the
existing position in the preview is preserved, so if you've just changed
the source a little you should be still quite close to where you were in
the preview, to see how the change has come out.

cperl-mode.el has M-x cperl-pod-to-manpage which does a similar thing,
but it goes from the disk copy of a buffer, so it can't work out of
tar-mode members etc, and it generates a new buffer every time.

Running man for the formatting is pretty unsophisticated, but it's a
fairly deliberate choice because pod2man+man is probably how most people
will look at your docs, so seeing what it gives is a good thing.  The
`perl-pod-preview' docstring has some further notes.")

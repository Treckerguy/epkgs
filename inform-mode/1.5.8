Inform is a compiler for adventure games by Graham Nelson,
available by anonymous FTP from
/ftp.ifarchive.org:/if-archive/programming/inform/

This file implements a major mode for editing Inform programs.  It
understands most Inform syntax and is capable of indenting lines
and formatting quoted strings.  Type `C-h m' within Inform mode for
more details.

Because Inform header files use the extension \".h\" just as C header
files do, the function `inform-maybe-mode' is provided.  It looks at
the contents of the current buffer; if it thinks the buffer is in
Inform, it selects inform-mode; otherwise it selects the mode given
by the variable `inform-maybe-other'.

Put this file somewhere on your load-path, and the following code in
your .emacs file:

 (autoload 'inform-mode \"inform-mode\" \"Inform editing mode.\" t)
 (autoload 'inform-maybe-mode \"inform-mode\" \"Inform/C header editing mode.\")
 (setq auto-mode-alist
       (append '((\"\\\\.h\\\\'\"   . inform-maybe-mode)
                 (\"\\\\.inf\\\\'\" . inform-mode))
               auto-mode-alist))

To turn on font locking add:
(add-hook 'inform-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)

If you use XEmacs and intend to use `inform-run-project' with a
console-mode interpreter, you need to have the eterm package
installed.  It should already be installed if you use XEmacs < 21,
but starting with XEmacs 21.1 you may need to download and install
it separately.

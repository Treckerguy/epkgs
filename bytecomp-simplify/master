 :commentary "\
This spot of code add warnings to the byte compiler to report on possible
simplifications in the code compiled.  Eg. (kill-buffer (current-buffer))
can be simplified to (kill-buffer nil).

The reports include

    char-before          \\
    char-after           | argument `point' can be omitted
    push-mark            /
    delete-windows-on    `current-buffer' can be omitted for Emacs 23 up
    eq nil               can be `null'
    equal 'sym           can be `eq'
    kill-buffer          `current-buffer' can be nil or omitted for Emacs 23
    lisp-indent-function can be `declare' within macro for Emacs 23 up
    princ \"\\n\"           can be `terpri'
    re-search-forward    \\ constant pattern can be plain `search-forward'
    re-search-backward   /   or `search-backward'
    search-forward       \\
    search-backward      | `point-min' or `point-max' limit can be nil
    re-search-forward    |
    re-search-backward   /
    up-list              \\ count==1 can be omitted for Emacs 21 up
    down-list            /


Things like `delete-windows-on' which are version-dependent are reported
only when the Emacs in use allows the simplification.  So
`delete-windows-on' is only reported in Emacs 23 up, and the message
includes a note that it's for 23 up.

The version-dependent bits might have scope for a kind of reverse check,
warning about a feature newer than a specified target Emacs supports.
Except conditionalized code would trigger it far too often.  There might
also be scope to declare a target Emacs version level, so as not to warn
about simplifications only possible in newer Emacs.

Checks not done:

`local-variable-p' argument `current-buffer' can be omitted in Emacs, but
not in XEmacs.  Reporting that would only spam out dual-targeted code.")

 :commentary "\
The functions in this file detect (`load-path-shadows-find')
and display (`list-load-path-shadows') potential load-path
problems that arise when Emacs Lisp files \"shadow\" each other.

For example, a file XXX.el early in one's load-path will shadow
a file with the same name in a later load-path directory.  When
this is unintentional, it may result in problems that could have
been easily avoided.  This occurs often (to me) when installing a
new version of emacs and something in the site-lisp directory
has been updated and added to the emacs distribution.  The old
version, now outdated, shadows the new one. This is obviously
undesirable.

The `list-load-path-shadows' function was run when you installed
this version of emacs. To run it by hand in emacs:

    M-x list-load-path-shadows

or run it non-interactively via:

    emacs -batch -f list-load-path-shadows

Thanks to Francesco Potorti` <pot@cnuce.cnr.it> for suggestions,
rewritings & speedups.")

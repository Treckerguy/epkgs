==========

Tested on emacs23.1 with python2.6, ipython-9.1 and python-mode.el.
This file fix also normal completion (tab without anything) in the ipython-shell.
This file reuse some code of ipython.el.

 Dependencies:
 ============

 ipython (http://ipython.scipy.org/), ipython.el, python-mode.el.
 It's better to have rlcompleter2 (http://codespeak.net/rlcompleter2/) 
 Note that to use rlcompleter2, you have to add these lines in your
 your ~/.ipython/ipy_user_conf.py

    import rlcompleter2
    rlcompleter2.setup()

 You may want to use also anything-show-completion.el:(facultative)
 http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs/anything-show-completion.el

 Install: 
 =======

Setup anything-ipython:
Put this file in your load path.
Add to .emacs:

(require 'anything-ipython)
(define-key py-mode-map (kbd \"M-<tab>\") 'anything-ipython-complete)
(define-key py-shell-map (kbd \"M-<tab>\") 'anything-ipython-complete)
(define-key py-mode-map (kbd \"C-c M\") 'anything-ipython-import-modules-from-buffer)

If you want to use anything-show-completion.el,(facultative)
<http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs/anything-show-completion.el>
add these lines:

(when (require 'anything-show-completion nil t)
  (use-anything-show-completion 'anything-ipython-complete
                                '(length initial-pattern)))

 Usage: 
 =====
1) From your *.py file, start ipython interpreter with C-c !
2) Import module(s) you need for completion from interpreter.
   e.g \"import os\"
   You can also import all import entries of your current *.py file
   with `anything-ipython-import-modules-from-buffer'.
   Note that `py-execute-buffer' (C-c C-c) will load also all modules
   of your .py file.
3) Use M-x anything-ipython-complete or M-<tab> to have completion.")

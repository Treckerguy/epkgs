This script updates a block of boilerplate comment text at the top of the
source code file in the current buffer.  By default, the text is inserted
from the file named `NOTICE-TEXT' in the same directory as the file.
`noticeify' makes a half-hearted attempt to use appropriate commenting
characters, based on the current major mode, so you can use insert the same
`NOTICE-TEXT' file into files written in any of several programming
languages.  The boilerplate text will be inserted between two cookies lines
`NOTICE' and `NOTICE-END', which result in something like the following.

    /*
     * NOTICE()
     * 
     * Copyright (C) 1969 Foo Corp.
     *
     * Blah blah blah...
     *
     * NOTICE-END
     */

You can also specify on a per-file basis whether to use boilerplate text
file other than `NOTICE-TEXT' by inserting a relative pathname or filename
between the parentheses in the `NOTICE()' cookie.  This is useful when you
have code files in multiple subdirectories that all use the same
`NOTICE-TEXT' file from a parent directory, in which case the would have
`NOTICE(..)' cookies.  It's also useful when a few of your files require
different boilerplate text, such as if they are not covered under the same
copyright license, in which case you might have cookies such as
`NOTICE(NOTICE-TEXT-FOR-BAZ-LIB)'.

Note that `noticeify' is a quick&dirty thing I hacked up to add copyright
notices to a bunch of files in different languages a while ago.  This is not
the best way to do things (e.g., it should really use the syntax table for
the major mode, and it should also have a batch mode).")

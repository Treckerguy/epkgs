AutoHotKey: Automation, Hotkeys and Scripting for Windows at
http://www.autohotkey.com/ is a cool tool to make daily life
with Windows easier or even fun!

This is a X/GNU Emacs mode for editing AutoHotKey scripts.

Place this file somewhere in your load-path, byte-compile it and add the
following line to your ~/.xemacs/init.el resp. ~/.emacs:

(setq ahk-syntax-directory \"PATHTO/AutoHotkey/Extras/Editors/Syntax/\")
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.ahk$\" . ahk-mode))
(autoload 'ahk-mode \"ahk-mode\")

The first time ahk-mode.el is started it will ask you for the path to the
Syntax directory if not set already.  You will find it as a subdirectory
of your AHK installation.

For example if you installed AHK at C:\\Programms\\AutoHotKey it will be
C:/Programms/AutoHotKey/Extras/Editors/Syntax or a corresponding cygwin
path!

When opening a script file you will get:
- syntax highlighting
- indention, completion and command help (bound to \"TAB\")
- insertion of command templates (bound to \"C-c C-i\") 
- electric braces (typing \"{\" will also insert \"}\" and place point in
  between) 
- lookup the docs on a command via w3 (place point on command and type
  \"C-c C-h\")

Please send bug-reports or feature suggestions to hackATrobfDOTde.")

Extensions to `browse-kill-ring.el'.

 Put this in your init file (~/.emacs):

   (require 'browse-kill-ring+)

 If you also use library `second-sel.el' (recommended), then
 require that library before this one.  If both libraries are used,
 then `browse-kill-ring-alternative-ring' is the secondary
 selection ring, and `browse-kill-ring' lets you use either that
 ring or the `kill-ring' as the selection ring to browse or pop.
 You can even use both, in different `browse-kill-ring' display
 buffers.  In such a buffer (in `browse-kill-ring-mode'), `o' pops
 to the list for the other ring.

 You can customize the set of commands to be recognized as yank
 commands and alternative yank commands - see options
 `browse-kill-ring-yank-commands' and
 `browse-kill-ring-alternative-yank-commands'.  The alternative
 yank commands are commands that yank using a different selection
 ring, for example, the secondary yank commands defined by library
 `second-sel.el'.

 Following a yank command or alternative yank command, `M-y' pops
 the appropriate type of selection.  A prefix arg N chooses the Nth
 previous selection in the ring.

 Otherwise (not following a yank or alternative yank), `M-y'
 browses the current selection ring.  A prefix arg switches to the
 other selection ring.  If you are in a `browse-kill-ring' buffer,
 then `M-y' switches to the other ring even without a prefix arg.

 If you do not use library `second-sel.el', then there is no other
 selection ring.  `M-y' either pops (following a yank) or browses
 (not following a yank) the `kill-ring'.

 FWIW, I customize `browse-kill-ring-quit-action' to be
 `browse-kill-ring-quit-deletes-window/frame'.  This is similar to
 the default behavior, except that if the window is dedicated, then
 the frame is deleted.


 Commands defined here:

   `browse-kill-ring-switch-to-other-kill-ring',

   `browse-kill-ring-alternative-yank-commands',
   `browse-kill-ring-yank-commands'.

 Non-interactive functions defined here:

   `browse-kill-ring-quit-deletes-window/frame',
   `browse-kill-ring-remove-dups',
   `browse-kill-ring-target-overlay-at'.

 Internal variables defined here:

 ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `browse-kill-ring.el'
             have been REDEFINED HERE:

   `browse-kill-ring', `browse-kill-ring-current-string',
   `browse-kill-ring-default-keybindings',
   `browse-kill-ring-delete', `browse-kill-ring-do-append-insert',
   `browse-kill-ring-do-insert',
   `browse-kill-ring-do-prepend-insert', `browse-kill-ring-edit',
   `browse-kill-ring-edit-finish', `browse-kill-ring-forward',
   `browse-kill-ring-mode' `browse-kill-ring-setup'.


 ***** NOTE: The following standard functions defined in `simple.el'
             have been ADVISED HERE:

   `kill-new'.

 Key bindings defined here for `browse-kill-ring-mode-map':

    `t'     - `toggle-browse-kill-ring-display-style'
    `TAB'   - `browse-kill-ring-forward'
    `S-TAB' - `browse-kill-ring-previous'

 NOTE: This library automatically calls
 `browse-kill-ring-default-keybindings'.  If you do not want that,
 then comment out this call (at the end of the file).


 TO DO:

 @@@@@@ BUG: `1' doesn't work for secondary - it deletes an item
 each time.  It's because `kill-new' is not the appropriate thing
 to add back the item at the head.  Need to look for all
 occurrences of `kill-new' and replace by applying some function
 variable whose value is appropriate to the given sel-ring type.

 The problematic code (the occurrences of `kill-new'):
 `browse-kill-ring-insert-and-move'
 `browse-kill-ring-prepend-insert-and-move',
 `browse-kill-ring-append-insert-and-move',

 Probably should also factor those three, as I did for
 `browse-kill-ring-do-*-insert'.


 @@@@@@ BUG: `browse-kill-ring-original-window' should work for the
 secondary ring too.  It works by advising `kill-new'.  At least I
 should document that it has an effect only for the `kill-ring'.


 @@@@@@ BUG: `browse-kill-ring-edit': membership of kill text is
 not sufficient, since there can be duplicates.")

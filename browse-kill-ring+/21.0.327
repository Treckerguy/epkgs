Extensions to `browse-kill-ring.el'.

 Put this in your init file (~/.emacs):

   (require 'browse-kill-ring+)

 If you also use library `second-sel.el' (recommended), then
 require that library before this one.  If both libraries are used,
 then `browse-kill-ring-alternative-ring' is the secondary
 selection ring, and `browse-kill-ring' lets you use either that
 ring or the `kill-ring' as the selection ring to browse or pop.

 You can customize the set of commands to be recognized as yank
 commands and alternative yank commands - see options
 `browse-kill-ring-yank-commands' and
 `browse-kill-ring-alternative-yank-commands'.  The alternative
 yank commands are commands that yank using a different selection
 ring, for example, the secondary yank commands defined by library
 `second-sel.el'.

 Following a yank command or alternative yank command, `M-y' pops
 the appropriate type of selection.  A prefix arg N chooses the Nth
 previous selection in the ring.

 Otherwise (not following a yank or alternative yank), `M-y'
 browses the current selection ring.  A prefix arg switches to the
 other selection ring.  If you are in a `browse-kill-ring' buffer,
 then `M-y' switches to the other ring even without a prefix arg.

 If you do not use library `second-sel.el', then there is no other
 selection ring.  `M-y' either pops (following a yank) or browses
 (not following a yank) the `kill-ring'.

 FWIW, I customize `browse-kill-ring-quit-action' to be
 `browse-kill-ring-quit-deletes-window/frame'.  This is similar to
 the default behavior, except that if the window is dedicated, then
 the frame is deleted.

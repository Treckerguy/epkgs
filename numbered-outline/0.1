 :commentary "\
Numbered Outline mode is a minor mode providing extensions to both
Outline mode and Outline minor mode for dealing with hierarchical
numbered outlines, for example

1 Top-level heading
1.1 Subheading
1.2 Another subheading
1.2.1 Subsubheading

When turned on for a buffer, Numbered Outline mode sets
`outline-regexp' to `numbered-outline-regexp' which matches numbered
headings and sets `outline-level' to `numbered-outline-level' which
calculates the heading level appropriately.  Functions are provided
for promoting and demoting heading levels in the region, and for
canonically renumbering headings in the buffer.

You can customize `numbered-outline-regexp' (for example, to match
heading numbers preceded by a comment indicator or a piece of
markup), as long as you make sure that your new regexp has the right
set of capturing parentheses -- see the documentation for that
variable for details.")

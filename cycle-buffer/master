Description:
------------
cycle-buffer is yet another way of selecting buffers. Instead of prompting
you for a buffer name, cycle-buffer switches to the most recently used
buffer, and repeated invocations of cycle-buffer-forward switch to less
recently visited buffers. If you accidentally overshoot, calling
cycle-buffer-backward goes back. You should issue consecutive cycle command
pretty quickly: if there is some intervening command between two cycling
commands, or if a settable timeout expires, the cycling is reset and the
next cycle-buffer will get you to the last buffer.

I find this to be the fastest buffer-switching mechanism; it's like C-x
b <return> w/out the return, but it's not limited to the most recently
accessed buffer.  Plus you never have to remember buffer names; you
just keep cycling until you recognize the buffer you're searching for. The
buffer ring is shown in the echo area centered around the current buffer;
if you see the name of the buffer you are looking for a few positions away
from the center, you can give an argument to cycle-buffer to get directly
to it. Positive arguments move to the right, negative arguments to the
left.

In addition to cycling forward and backward, there are two versions of the
command provided: normal and \"permissive\". The permissive version allows
(as per factory settings) buffers of the form *bufname*, while the normal
version does not.

Installation:
-------------
Add these lines in your .emacs:
  (autoload 'cycle-buffer \"cycle-buffer\" \"Cycle forward.\" t)
  (autoload 'cycle-buffer-backward \"cycle-buffer\" \"Cycle backward.\" t)
  (autoload 'cycle-buffer-permissive \"cycle-buffer\" \"Cycle forward allowing *buffers*.\" t)
  (autoload 'cycle-buffer-backward-permissive \"cycle-buffer\" \"Cycle backward allowing *buffers*.\" t)
  (autoload 'cycle-buffer-toggle-interesting \"cycle-buffer\" \"Toggle if this buffer will be considered.\" t)
  (global-set-key [(f9)]        'cycle-buffer-backward)
  (global-set-key [(f10)]       'cycle-buffer)
  (global-set-key [(shift f9)]  'cycle-buffer-backward-permissive)
  (global-set-key [(shift f10)] 'cycle-buffer-permissive)
You may want to adjust the keyboard bindings to suit your taste. See below
for other customisable variables.

Todo
----
- try not to shift the list in the echo area, move the [ ] only.
- in order not to switch to the intermediate buffers, implement an electric
  minibuffer mode where cycle-buffer and cycle-buffer-backward only scroll
  the buffer list in the minibuffer, and the buffer is switched only upon
  exit from that mode (partly suggested by terry@santafe.edu)
SUGGESTIONS ARE WELCOME.

ChangeLog
---------
Fri Jun  7 11:00:32 1996 [VA]
floatp-safe is not defined in emacs, pointed by tim@ipac.caltech.edu

Sat Jun  8 17:27:57 1996 [VA]
alex.lefaive@Eng.Sun.COM suggested an \"inverse\" of cycle-buffer-ignore, a
variable that would only *allow* certain buffers. I decided to generalise
the two to cycle-buffer-filter, a general and-or form.

Sat Jun  8 20:11:23 1996 [VA]
Doc fix, pointed by terry@santafe.edu

Mon Jun 10 11:55:25 1996 [VA]
Added cycle-buffer-interesting and cycle-buffer-toggle-interesting,
suggestion by Josh MacDonald <jmacd@CS.Berkeley.EDU>

Mon Mar 24 14:54:37 1997 [Martin Stjernholm <mast@lysator.liu.se>]
Added cycle-buffer-next-command to pre-command-hook to discard changes
to the buffer list caused by buffers we just fly through.

Wed May 21 02:29:18 1997 [VA]
cycle-buffer-message: don't log the buffer list onto the message log

Mon Dec  1 18:57:31 1997 [VA]
cycle-buffer-shorten-name: turn ` ' in buf name to `_', also save a couple
of spaces around each name.")

RULES:

Gomoku is a game played between two players on a rectangular board.  Each
player, in turn, marks a free square of its choice. The winner is the first
one to mark five contiguous squares in any direction (horizontally,
vertically or diagonally).

I have been told that, in \"The TRUE Gomoku\", some restrictions are made
about the squares where one may play, or else there is a known forced win
for the first player. This program has no such restriction, but it does not
know about the forced win, nor do I.
See http://renju.nu/r1rulhis.htm for more information.


There are two main places where you may want to customize the program: key
bindings and board display. These features are commented in the code. Go
and see.


HOW TO USE:

The command \"M-x gomoku\" displays a
board, the size of which depends on the size of the current window. The
size of the board is easily modified by giving numeric arguments to the
gomoku command and/or by customizing the displaying parameters.

Emacs plays when it is its turn. When it is your turn, just put the cursor
on the square where you want to play and hit RET, or X, or whatever key you
bind to the command gomoku-human-plays. When it is your turn, Emacs is
idle: you may switch buffers, read your mail, ... Just come back to the
*Gomoku* buffer and resume play.


ALGORITHM:

The algorithm is briefly described in section \"THE SCORE TABLE\". Some
parameters may be modified if you want to change the style exhibited by the
program.")

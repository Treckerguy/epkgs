It provides commands to run the project-buffer actions: such as
build, clean, run, debug and update while browsing the files
belonging to this project.

It also provides a command to directly go to the project-buffer
attached to the current file.

How does it work?

When you open a file from the project-buffer; it will attach the
project-buffer to the file's buffer.
The project-buffer is stored inside a local variable called:
 `project-buffer-mode-p-attached-project-buffer'.

To install it:

Put the following lines in your .emacs:

(eval-after-load \"project-buffer-mode\"
 '(progn
    (require 'project-buffer-mode+)
    (project-buffer-mode-p-setup)))


By default this bind the following keys:
 C-x p s    Go to the project-buffer attached to the current file
 C-x p B    Kick the 'build action from the attached project-buffer.
 C-x p C    Kick the 'clean action from the attached project-buffer.
 C-x p R    Kick the 'run action from the attached project-buffer.
 C-x p D    Kick the 'debug action from the attached project-buffer.
 C-x p U    Kick the 'update action from the attached project-buffer.")

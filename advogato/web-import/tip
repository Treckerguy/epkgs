advogato.el implements the XML-RPC interface to advogato.org
Needs xml-rpc.el from http://elisp.info/

For ease of use:
I use the following commands in my .emacs file:

(require 'advogato) ;; will autoload advogato.el 
(global-set-key \"\\C-cbs\" 'advogato-start-post)

C-c b s will switch to a new buffer where you can compose a
post.

C-x C-s    -- post-and-publish current buffer to the blog.
              Calling blogger-save-post with an prefix argument
              (i.e. C-u C-c C-c) will prompt for which weblog
              to use.

C-c C-c    -- identical to C-x C-s, but will also bury the buffer.


Changelog
v1.0 -- (date?) -  elimentary mode with lots of ugly code 

v1.1 -- 11 Feb 2002 - Removed `url-insert-entities-in-string' as this is now
                      being handled at xml-rpc layer. Removes the bug which
                      escapes HTML markups.
v1.2 -- 11 Feb 2002 - Improved cookie support. Now can read the advogato
                      cookies from Mozilla/galeon/url cookies file.
v1.3 -- 11 Feb 2004 - Allow the user to set the mozilla profile name
                      (Thanks - Muli Ben-Yehuda <mulix@mulix.org>)
v1.4 -- 13 Feb 2004 - provide 'advogato' feature (Muli) 
Please note once again that advogato.el needs the v1.6.1 of xml-rpc.el
from http://elisp.info")

This package lets the user launch a search, with a single key combination,
for the word under the cursor, in the current repository, or the current
directory, or in the set of currently open files.

Works nicely in combination with grep-a-lot and repository-root libraries.

Installation:

1. Put this file in a directory that is a member of load-path, and
   byte-compile it (e.g. with `M-x byte-compile-file') for better
   performance.
2. Add the following to your ~/.emacs:
   ;(require 'repository-root) ; optional: needed for repository-wide search
   (require 'grep-o-matic)
3. Customize grep-o-matic with `M-x customize-group grep-o-matic'

Repository-wide search requires customization of the repository root function,
unless the repository-root libarary is loaded before grep-o-matic.

Default Key Bindings:

M-] M-/         Search for current word in current repository
M-] M-.         Search for current word in current directory (recursive)
M-] M-,         Search for current word in currently opened files
                Prefix these with C-u to edit the search regexp")

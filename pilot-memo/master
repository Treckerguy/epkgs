Inspired by David Maslen :)

Usage : M-x save-buffer-to-pilot

It prompts for the title of the memo and the category to store it
in.

In the Gnus Summary buffer, you can also 
M-x gnus-summary-save-article-pilot
to save the current article to your PalmOS device.

You need the `pilot-link' software installed, as this code simply
runs the external `install-memo' program to do all the hard work.

`pilot-link' source can be found at
ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/ or, if you're running one of
the more popular Linux distributions, there may be an installable
package available as part of the distribution....")

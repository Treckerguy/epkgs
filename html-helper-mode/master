Installation:
  Add this line in your .emacs:
    (autoload 'html-helper-mode \"html-helper-mode\" \"Yay HTML\" t)
  To invoke html-helper-mode automatically on .html files, do this:
    (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '(\"\\\\.html$\" . html-helper-mode) auto-mode-alist))

  This mode requires another lisp file, tempo.el. This can be
    retrieved from ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/emacs/tempo.el
  Xemacs users need to have auc-menu installed.
  Emacs 18 users need to have auc-menu and add-hook installed.
  If your OS has broken 14 character filenames
     this mode will also work with the name \"html-mode.el\".

Configuration:
  see the \"user variables\" section, or the documentation on configuration
  in http://www.santafe.edu/~nelson/tools/. There are variables you want to
  configure, particularly html-helper-address-string and
  html-helper-use-expert-menu

Description:
  html-helper-mode makes it easier to write HTML documents. This mode
  handles inserting HTML codes in a variety of ways (keybindings, menus,
  completion in the buffer). It also supports indentation, timestamps,
  skeletons for new documents, hilit19 patterns, and a variety of other
  things. For the full skinny, see the HTML documentation that comes
  with the package or is at http://www.santafe.edu/~nelson/tools/

Thank yous:
  David KÃ¥gedal <davidk@lysator.liu.se> for the tempo code which
    forms the core of the HTML insertion, as well as the HTML+ tags.
  Marc Hedlund <march@europa.com> for general encouragement and
    many helpful suggestions, especially with HTML/2.0 compliance
    and form design.
  Ulrik Dickow <dickow@nbi.dk> for the font-lock code
  Denis Howe <dbh@doc.ic.ac.uk> for writing browse-url.
  Magnus Homann <d0asta@dtek.chalmers.se> and Jamshid Afshar
    <jamshid@ses.com> for timestamp suggestions.
  Everyone who sent me a version of menus (16 in all!)
  Marc Andreessen <marca@mcom.com> for writing the original html-mode

The newest version of html-helper-mode should always be available from
  http://www.santafe.edu/~nelson/tools/

This code was writting using folding.el, a wonderful folding editor
minor mode for emacs. That's what the strange {{{ comments are for.

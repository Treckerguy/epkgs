Quick start:
Type number 0 in any place, then put cursor on the number, M-x
incr-dwim. See the number turn to be 1. Now try with a prefix
argument 4: C-u 4 C-x z. The number change to 5. The number can
also be a hex, such as 0x1, 0x01.

If This is not interesting, then type character I in any place,
then M-x incr-dwim RET C-x z z z z z. You can try it until tired.
the number is increase in roman.

Now try play with weekdays. Put cursor on the word \"monday\", and do
with the same way.

The command also can do with a rectangle region, the feature
require transient-mark-mode is ON. For example, when select a
rectangle like this:
  7
  7
  7
then use M-x incr-dwim, the region will change to:
  7
  8
  9
When select a rectangle region, If with a numeric prefix argument,
the region will increase or decrease by the argument, but if the
prefix argument is not numberic which invoke by C-u M-x incr-dwim,
you will be ask several question about some paramters, such as
increment, justify, fill character and so on.

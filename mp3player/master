Some codes and ideas borrowed from mpg123 by HIROSE Yuuji [yuuji@gentei.org]
and from mp3-tools by Steve Kemp <skx@tardis.ed.ac.uk>
Many Thanks to you Yuuji and Steve!!

This package was developed and tested under GNU/Linux - Suze 6.2 and  
Emacs 20.5.1.  It was reported to work also under some version of
Xemacs with some errors at compile time.

[30/01/2003] - I'm now using it under Emacs 21.2.1 - Windows XP
               I made some changes in version 1.3 to support windows.
               I hate windows.

The programs mpg123 and aumix are required.  They can be downloaded from:

http://www.mpg123.de/ and http://jpj.net/~trevor/aumix.html

Windows user need to download mpg123 and the mixer program from

http://www3.tky.3web.ne.jp/~takuroho/files/mpg123/

CAUTION: The mixer.exe program IS NOT and upgrade for mixer.exe already 
         present in your c:/WINDOWS directory.  DO NOT REPLACE.

Developped while listening: Chara, the Butthole Surfers, Black Sabbath
                            and a lot of Ska!")

 :commentary "\
Minor mode to highlight the line the cursor is in. You can change colors
of foreground (text) and background. The default behaviour is to set
only a background color, so that font-lock fontification colors remain
visible (syntax coloring). Enable a buffer using the command
`highlight-current-line-minor-mode' and customize via:

  M-x customize-group highlight-current-line <RET>.

You can select whether the whole line (from left to right window border)
is marked or only the really filled parts of the line (from left window
border to the last char in the line). The second behaviour is suitable
if it's important for you to see trailing spaces or tabs in a
line. Customize the variable `highlight-current-line-whole-line' (or use
the function `highlight-current-line-whole-line-on' retained for
compatibility with prior versions).

You may enable the minor-mode automatically for (almost) all buffers by
customizing the variable `highlight-current-line-globally' (or using the
compatibility command `highlight-current-line-on').  Buffers whose
buffer-name match the regular expression in the customizable variable
`highlight-current-line-ignore-regexp' do not highlighted.  You can
extend or redefine this regexp. This works together with the default
ignore function `highlight-current-line-ignore-function'. You can
redefine this function to implement your own criterias.

(The functions `highlight-current-line-on',
`highlight-current-line-set-fg-color' and
`highlight-current-line-set-bg-color' are retained for backward
compatibility. There's a special color \"none\" defined to set no color.)")

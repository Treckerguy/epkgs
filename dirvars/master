Emacs allows you to specify local variable values for use when
editing a file either in the first line or in a local variables
list.

This file provides similar functionality, but for an entire
directory tree.

You simply place an .emacs-dirvars file in the root of your
project's tree, and you can then set emacs variables like you would
in a Local Variables: section at the end of a file.  E.g. the
contents of a typical dirvars file might look like this:

   ;; -*- emacs-lisp -*-
   ;;
   ;; This file is processed by the dirvars emacs package.  Each variable
   ;; setting below is performed when this dirvars file is loaded.
   ;;
   indent-tabs-mode: nil
   tab-width: 8
   show-trailing-whitespace: t
   indicate-empty-lines: t

Much of this code is stolen and modified from the standard Emacs
files.el

This code refuses to set any symbol that meets any of these
criteria (this criteria is stolen from files.el):

  - the symbol is in the ignored-local-variables list
  - the symbol has the risky-local-variable property.
  - the symbol name ends in -hook(s), -function(s), -form(s),
    -program, -command, or -predicate.

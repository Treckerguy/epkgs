This is FLARC!

I own a lot of recording equipment, and I generate lots and lots of
audio files in various formats---ranging from less than a second to
several hours in length. Furthermore, I work with several other
musicians, with whom I constantly exchange recordings. We only want
to keep about ten percent of this stuff, but we have so much stuff
now that we need help to organize the work of reviewing and
annotating the material.

The purpose of FLARC is to help you:

 - extract audio files from USB Mass Storage devices (for example zoom.el)
   or from CD-Audio / WAV files / etc
 - create an archive from extracted audio files, or add to an existing archive
 - store archive contents as FLAC
 - review, rename, annotate, and slice audio files
 - create an org-mode file index for each archive with  review file foo.bar
 - define audio tags and tag your files with auto-completion of tag names
 - search annotations/tags across multiple archives to find relevant audio
 - carefully delete unwanted recordings
 - create ogg vorbis files upon request
 - burn CD's?
 - tag regions of files? (or just split files, then tag the pieces...)

You can also use FLARC to organize backups of your purchased CD's; for
example, when ripping to FLAC from A Better CD Encoder (\"abcde\").

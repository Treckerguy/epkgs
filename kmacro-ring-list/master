 :commentary "\
In the course of editing text in Emacs a handful of keyboard macros
(kmacros) may be gathered for some repetitive but often trivial
tasks. Incidentally they are not significant enough to deserve a
name and it is best to leave them in kmacro ring. However for the
time being, the facility provided by Emacs is not intuitive even
for a small number of kmacros. This little package hopefully will
make such a task straightforward by displaying the list of kmacros
nicely in a buffer as well as offering key bindings to manipulate
them. The most useful function, in my view, is hitting RET to set
the kmacro at point to be the current one. The main entry function
is `kmacro-ring-list' and you may bind it to a key as in this
example:

   (global-set-key (kbd \"<f5>\") 'kmacro-ring-list)

Comments and bug fixes are welcome.")

Extensions to `icomplete.el'.

 Faces defined here:

   `icompletep-choices', `icompletep-determined',
   `icompletep-keys', `icompletep-nb-candidates'.

 User option defined here:

   `icompletep-prospects-length'.

 Macros defined here (but identical to those in Emacs 23):

   `with-local-quit', `with-no-input'.


 ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `icomplete.el'
             have been REDEFINED HERE:

   `icomplete-completions' -
      Prepends total number of candidates.
      Sorts alternatives alphabetically, uses different face.
      Highlights key-binding text.
      Appends number of remaining cycle candidates (for Icicles).

   `icomplete-exhibit' -
      Saves match-data.
      Doesn't insert if input begins with `('
        (e.g. `repeat-complex-command').
      Ensures that the insertion doesn't deactivate mark.


 This file should be loaded after loading the standard GNU file
 `icomplete.el'.  So, in your `~/.emacs' file, do this:
 (eval-after-load \"icomplete\" '(progn (require 'icomplete+)))")

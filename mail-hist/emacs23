Thanks to Jim Blandy for mentioning ring.el.  It saved a lot of
time.

To use this package, put it in a directory in your load-path, and
put this in your .emacs file:

(load \"mail-hist\" nil t)

Or you could do it with autoloads and hooks in your .emacs:

(add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'mail-hist-define-keys)
(add-hook 'mail-send-hook 'mail-hist-put-headers-into-history)
(add-hook 'vm-mail-mode-hook 'mail-hist-define-keys) ;or rmail, etc
(autoload 'mail-hist-define-keys \"mail-hist\")
(autoload 'mail-hist-put-headers-into-history \"mail-hist\")

Once it's installed, use M-p and M-n from mail headers to recover
previous/next contents in the history for that header, or, in the
body of the message, to recover previous/next text of the message.
This only applies to outgoing mail -- mail-hist ignores received
messages.

Although repeated history requests do clear out the text from the
previous request, an isolated request just inserts its text at
point, so that you can mix the histories of different messages
easily.  This might be confusing at times, but there should be no
problems that undo can't handle.")

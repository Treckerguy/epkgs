This package provides \"Screen Lines\" minor mode.
In this minor mode, the following standard commands work in terms of
screen lines, as opposed to text lines when they are called interactively.

    `beginning-of-line' (C-a)
    `end-of-line'       (C-e)
    `next-line'         (C-n, down)
    `previous-line'     (C-p, up)
    `kill-line'         (C-k)

Screen Lines minor mode should be handy when you edit a file with
long lines like this: <DT><A HREF=\"http://tiny-tools.sourceforge.net/emacs-keys.html\" ADD_DATE=\"977149523\" LAST_VISIT=\"977488726\" LAST_MODIFIED=\"977149517\">Emacs keybinding help page</A>

In order to test this as you see this file, proceed as follows:
  1: Load this package:  M-x eval-buffer
  2: Toggle the mode for the current buffer: M-x screen-lines-mode
  3: Move around the above long line.

You might want to check screenline.el written by Joshua E. Buhl
<josh@math.uni-bonn.de> which does text property business properly and
doesn't use `defadvice' facility.
Or window-lines.el by enami tsugutomo <enami@ptgd.sony.co.jp> which is
lightweight.


Text lines vs Screen lines:
                                            See \"(elisp)Text Lines\"
                                                \"(elisp)Screen Lines\"

  Screen lines are defined by the way the text appears horizontally
  on the screen, whereas text lines are defined in terms of newline
  characters as line delimiters.
  
  Emacs standard line oriented point moving commands such as
  `next-line' and `previous-line' are based on text lines.

  A text line is a single screen line:
    * if it is short enough to fit the width of the selected window, or
    * if it is truncated on the screen as follows:

         |                                       |
         |The quick brown fox jumped over the la$|
         |                                       |

  A text line is divided into several screen lines:
    * if it is folded on the screen as follows:

         |                                       |
         |The quick brown fox jumped over the la\\|
         |zy dogs.<RET>                          |
         |                                       |

      The above text line consists of the two screen lines,
      \"The quick brown fox jumped over the la\" and
      \"zy dogs.<RET>\".

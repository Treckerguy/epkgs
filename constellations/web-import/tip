constellations.el provides a constellation abbreviation lookup tool. I
can never remember the abbreviations for most constellations so, when I'm
writing my observing logs (http://www.davep.org/astronomy/logs/) I find
this little tool handy -- saves me from having to remember.

The latest constellations.el is always available from:

  <URL:http://www.davep.org/emacs/#constellations.el>

INSTALLATION:

o Drop constellations.el somwehere into your `load-path'. Try your
  site-lisp directory for example (you might also want to byte-compile the
  file).

o Add the following autoload statement to your ~/.emacs file:

  (autoload 'constellation-insert-abbr \"constellations\" \"Insert constellation abbreviation from name.\" t)")

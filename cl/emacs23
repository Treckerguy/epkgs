These are extensions to Emacs Lisp that provide a degree of
Common Lisp compatibility, beyond what is already built-in
in Emacs Lisp.

This package was written by Dave Gillespie; it is a complete
rewrite of Cesar Quiroz's original cl.el package of December 1986.

Bug reports, comments, and suggestions are welcome!

This file contains the portions of the Common Lisp extensions
package which should always be present.


Future notes:

Once Emacs 19 becomes standard, many things in this package which are
messy for reasons of compatibility can be greatly simplified.  For now,
I prefer to maintain one unified version.")

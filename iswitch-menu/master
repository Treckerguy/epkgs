SYNOPSIS

This code replaces tmm-prompt with something a lot more convenient.
Prompted by the horrible navigation menus in the otherwise
*excellent* emacs-rails library, this code should make using menus
without a mouse or X easy on the brain and fingers.

to use: put the following in your init file and make sure this
file is in your load-path:

(require 'iswitch-menu)

you can then access the console menu by running
M-x tmm-menubar
note that this will work even if you're using a GUI menu bar

CUSTOMIZATION

You can customize the menus using the iswitch-menu customization
group:

M-x customize-group <ENTER> iswitch-menu <ENTER>

you can toggle iswitch-menu-override-tmm-prompt if you want to use
iswitch-menu-prompt only for specific modes or commands.

REPORTING BUGS

This code should work as advertized.  If you find any situations
where it doesn't work, try the the latest version from
http://github.com/joodie/iswitch-menu/

If that doesn't work either, please contact the author.  If any
errors occur during the creation or executiong of a particular
menu, please provide the output of M-x iswitch-menu-report as run
immediately after the error.

USING THIS CODE WITH EMACS-RAILS

To use with emacs-rails navigation: same as above, and switch on
the Rails Always Use Text Menus option in the rails customization
group.

Alternatively, if you don't like to globally override tmm-prompt,
get a version of emacs-rails with configurable text menus, like
this one: http://github.com/remvee/emacs-rails/tree/master and
switch on rails-always-use-text-menu and set
rails-text-menu-function to #'iswitch-menu-prompt")

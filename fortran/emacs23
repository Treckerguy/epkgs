This mode is documented in the Emacs manual.

Note that it is for editing Fortran77 or Fortran90 fixed source
form.  For editing Fortran 90 free format source, use `f90-mode'
(f90.el).  It is meant to support the GNU Fortran language
implemented by g77 (its extensions to Fortran77 and
interpretations, e.g. of blackslash in strings).")

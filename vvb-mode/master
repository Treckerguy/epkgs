This package implements a minor mode for XEmacs which, when enabled,
will display a transient or permanent visible vertical bar at a user-
specified column (ie, `vvb-column'), depending on the value of variable
`vvb-permanent-p'.  For a transient one, the bar is visible only when
the point is at a column >= `vvb-column'. The bar can also be made
\"sticky\" to the point regardless the value of `vvb-column'. If `vvb-columns'
is a list of columns, a set of vertical bars will show (see case #2 below).

This minor mode can be used with or without font-lock.

To use it, just add this line to your .emacs file:  (require 'vvb-mode)

Here are three usage scenarios that I imagine for this minor mode, and
the variables to use to satify the requirements:

1. Display a vertical bar always on the column where the point is.
   This is useful to see how things are aligned in the file.
   -- (setq-default vvb-sticky-p t)

2. Display a vertical bar *permanently* on a particular column.
   -- (setq-default vvb-column ?your-preference-here?
                    vvb-sticky-p nil
                    vvb-permanent-p t)

   If you want to display a set of vertical bars across each line, assign
   a list of columns to `vvb-columns' instead of `vvb-column'.

3. Display a vertical bar *transiently* on a particular column
   only if the point is past over that column.
   -- (setq-default vvb-column ?your-preference-here?
                    vvb-sticky-p nil
                    vvb-permanent-p nil)

In cases 2 & 3, you can make the bar extended all the way to the end of lines
by (setq-default vvb-right-on-eol-p t)

You can also change the appearance for the vertical bar by customizing this
face variable, `vvb-face'. eg:
(set-face-foreground vvb-face \"your-fg-color-name\")
(set-face-background vvb-face \"your-bg-color-name\")

Caveats/Bugs:

This minor-mode was developed and used in XEmacs v21.0b60. It's
also tested to be working for XEmacs 20,4, 19.16 & 19.14. Since
XEmacs-specific extents are used, it will not work out-of-box for
any version of FSF GNU Emacs.

The vertical bar doesn't show up on lines which are shorter than
the target column.  And it is not really vertical when it go
through the middle of a TAB char, or when variable-width fonts are
used.")

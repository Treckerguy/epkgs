Warning: this is alpha code!  Use at your own risk!  Don your

This file provides a new Gnus backend, nntodo, for storing todo
items.  Each todo item is a message but has a special header
`X-Todo-Priority' for the priority of a todo item.  It is possible
to sort todo items by creation date and by priority.  Sorting by
due date hasn't been done yet.")

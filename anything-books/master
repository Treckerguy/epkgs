This program collects PDF files in your book directory and show
them in the Anything interface with a preview image. You can select
a PDF more efficiently.

Installation:

This program is dependent on followings:
- anything.el (http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/download/anything.el)
- deferred.el (http://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-deferred/raw/master/deferred.el)
- concurrent.el (http://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-deferred/raw/master/concurrent.el)
- evince-thumbnailer, ImageMagick(convert)
If you have an another method to create a cover image from a PDF file,
you can use it with some customize variables.

Put anything-books.el in your load-path, and add following code.

(require 'anything-books)
(setq abks:boos-dir \"your PDF library path!\")
(global-set-key (kbd \"M-8\") 'anything-books-command) ; key bind example


Customize

## Cache directory

This program creates a cache directory for PDF cover images at the
PDF directory.  The directory name of the cache directory is the
value of `abks:cache-dir', the default is `.cache'.

## PDF cover image

The cover images for the PDF files are created by the program
`abks:mkcover-cmd', the default is `evince-thumbnailer' which is
default document browser of the GNOME desktop environment.  If you
have the ImageMagick and the GhostScript, you can use the command
`convert' to make a cover image. Note that `evince-thumbnailer'
works faster than `convert'.

Mac users (Leopard or later)  use `qlmanager' to create a cover
image.

The other programs can be also available, such as `pdfimages',
`pdf2png' and so on.")

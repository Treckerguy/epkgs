Kind of hard to describe - try it! :-) Basically, if you're on a \"*\",
it will delete the \"*\" and then change all references using that variable
in the function from \"->\" to \".\". If you're not on a \"*\", then it will add
a \"*\" and change references within the function form using \".\" to \"->\".")

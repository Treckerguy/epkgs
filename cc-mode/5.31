 :commentary "\
NOTE: Read the commentary below for the right way to submit bug reports!
NOTE: See the accompanying texinfo manual for details on using this mode!
Note: The version string is in cc-defs.

This package provides GNU Emacs major modes for editing C, C++,
Objective-C, Java, CORBA's IDL, Pike and AWK code.  As of the
latest Emacs and XEmacs releases, it is the default package for
editing these languages.  This package is called \"CC Mode\", and
should be spelled exactly this way.

CC Mode supports K&R and ANSI C, ANSI C++, Objective-C, Java,
CORBA's IDL, Pike and AWK with a consistent indentation model
across all modes.  This indentation model is intuitive and very
flexible, so that almost any desired style of indentation can be
supported.  Installation, usage, and programming details are
contained in an accompanying texinfo manual.

CC Mode's immediate ancestors were, c++-mode.el, cplus-md.el, and
cplus-md1.el..

To submit bug reports, type \"C-c C-b\".  These will be sent to
bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org (mirrored as the Usenet newsgroup
gnu.emacs.bug) as well as bug-cc-mode@gnu.org, which directly
contacts the CC Mode maintainers.  Questions can sent to
help-gnu-emacs@gnu.org (mirrored as gnu.emacs.help) and/or
bug-cc-mode@gnu.org.  Please do not send bugs or questions to our
personal accounts; we reserve the right to ignore such email!

Many, many thanks go out to all the folks on the beta test list.
Without their patience, testing, insight, code contributions, and
encouragement CC Mode would be a far inferior package.

documentation and separate individual files from:

 :commentary "\
This package provides GNU Emacs major modes for editing C, C++,
Objective-C, Java, IDL and Pike code.  As of the latest Emacs and
XEmacs releases, it is the default package for editing these
languages.  This package is called \"CC Mode\", and should be spelled
exactly this way.

CC Mode supports K&R and ANSI C, ANSI C++, Objective-C, Java,
CORBA's IDL, and Pike with a consistent indentation model across
all modes.  This indentation model is intuitive and very flexible,
so that almost any desired style of indentation can be supported.
Installation, usage, and programming details are contained in an
accompanying texinfo manual.

CC Mode's immediate ancestors were, c++-mode.el, cplus-md.el, and
cplus-md1.el..

NOTE: This mode does not perform font-locking (a.k.a syntactic
coloring, keyword highlighting, etc.) for any of the supported
modes.  Typically this is done by a package called font-lock.el
which we do *not* maintain.  You should contact the Emacs or XEmacs
maintainers for questions about coloring or highlighting in any
language mode.

To submit bug reports, type \"C-c C-b\".  These will be sent to
bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org (mirrored as the Usenet newsgroup
gnu.emacs.bug) as well as bug-cc-mode@gnu.org, which directly
contacts the CC Mode maintainers.  Questions can sent to
help-gnu-emacs@gnu.org (mirrored as gnu.emacs.help) and/or
bug-cc-mode@gnu.org.  Please use bug-cc-mode@gnu.org instead.
Please do not send bugs or questions to our personal accounts; we
reserve the right to ignore such email!

Many, many thanks go out to all the folks on the beta test list.
Without their patience, testing, insight, code contributions, and
encouragement CC Mode would be a far inferior package.

You can get the latest version of CC Mode, including PostScript
documentation and separate individual files from:

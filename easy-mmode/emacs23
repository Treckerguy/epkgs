 :commentary "\
Minor modes are useful and common.  This package makes defining a
minor mode easy, by focusing on the writing of the minor mode
functionalities themselves.  Moreover, this package enforces a
conventional naming of user interface primitives, making things
natural for the minor-mode end-users.

For each mode, easy-mmode defines the following:
<mode>      : The minor mode predicate. A buffer-local variable.
<mode>-map  : The keymap possibly associated to <mode>.
      see `define-minor-mode' documentation

eval
 (pp (macroexpand '(define-minor-mode <your-mode> <doc>)))
to check the result before using it.

The order in which minor modes are installed is important.  Keymap
lookup proceeds down minor-mode-map-alist, and the order there
tends to be the reverse of the order in which the modes were
installed.  Perhaps there should be a feature to let you specify
orderings.

Additionally to `define-minor-mode', the package provides convenient
ways to define keymaps, and other helper functions for major and minor modes.")

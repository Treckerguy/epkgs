This package is aimed at making it simple for programmers to
create diff's of files that they have been working on.

 When a file is loaded that matchs \"auto-diff-directory-regexp\"
a diff will be automatically created whenever the user saves
the file.


Usage

 Simply add the following lines to your .emacs file:

 ;; Generate diffs in a simple manner.
 (require 'auto-diff)

 ;; example only...
 (add-to-list 'auto-diff-directory-regexp \"/home/skx/Lisp/.*\\.el\")")

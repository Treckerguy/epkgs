 :commentary "\
Emacs 19.30 changed the behavior of execute-extended-command (i.e. the
command which lets you run other commands by typing ``M-x foo'' so that
if the variable `suggest-key-bindings' is set, it prints the keybinding
(if any) of the command to help you learn shortcuts.

Unfortunately, while that behavior is useful, it is also annoying
because you have to wait for the message to time out before the command
is actually executed.  Hinting at keybindings should be instructive but
not force you to use them just to avoid the delay nuisance; at the same
time you can't make the delay so short that you have no time to read the
message.

This package provides alternate behavior: it suggests key bindings
*after* the command has completed, and even then only if the user is
idle for at least a second (or whatever is set via the variable
`suggbind-suggest-key-bindings').  Emacs 20.1 and later have this
behavior too, but there are still some other differences.

This package cannot be autoloaded.  To use it, put the following in your
.emacs:

     (setq suggest-key-bindings nil) ; turn off builtin pre-command hints
     (load \"suggbind\")")

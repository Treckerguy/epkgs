 :commentary "\
This package is a stub, and will probably be abandoned.

Command defined here operate on frames, windows and buffers and
make it easier and faster to access certain functionality that
is already available using the default commands.

This library can be used by itself but was written as a helper
library for library `bob.el'.")

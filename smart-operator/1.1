When typing operators, this package can automatically insert spaces
before and after operators. For instance, `=' will become ` = ', `+='
will become ` += '. This is handy for writing C-style sources.

To use, put this file to your load-path and the following to your
~/.emacs:
            (require 'smart-operator)

Then `M-x smart-operator-mode' for toggling this minor mode.

Usage Tips
----------

- If you want it to insert operator with surrounding spaces , you'd
  better not type the front space yourself, instead, type operator
  directly. smart-operator-mode will also take this as a hint on how
  to properly insert spaces in some specific occasions. For
  example, in c-mode, `a*' -> `a * ', `char *' -> `char *'.

reimplementing as a minor mode and providing an initial patch for
that.")

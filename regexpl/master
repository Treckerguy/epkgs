The function `regexpl-search-replace-list' takes a cons-ed list of
patterns and replacements.  It find the nearest match (ties defer
to list order) then replaces with the corresponding match.

For example,

(regexpl-search-replace-list '((\"stopwatch\" . \"timer\")
                               (\"watch\" . \"wristwatch\")))

will replace occurrences of \"stopwatch\" first with \"timer\", but all
other occurrences of \"watch\" will be replaced with \"wristwatch\".")

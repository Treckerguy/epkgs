Resize all windows vertically to display as much information as possible
with the command `M-x pack-windows'.

Only windows that are on the left edge of the frame are taken into
account. The vertical space available in the frame is first divided
among all these windows. Then any window requireing less lines than it
got to display its whole buffer is shrinked, and the freed space is
divided equally among all the other windows.

If some vertical space remains afterwards, it is given in totality to
the currently selected window.

Do not shrink any window to less than `window-min-height'.

Shrink windows iteratively, performing at most `pack-windows-max-iteration'
iterations. The number of iterations really performed will be
displayed in the echo area if `pack-windows-verbose' is non-nil.")

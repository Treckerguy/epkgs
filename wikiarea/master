Hey there.

The Emacs Wiki (http://www.emacswiki.org/) is just about the
coolest thing ever.

Here's some code to help you keep up with all of the Elisp in
the Emacs Wiki's Elisp area, which lives here:
		 http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/

Basically, the idea is that you make a directory in which you
keep elisp files from the emacs wiki. This is
\"~/elisp/from-the-emacs-wiki/\" by default. You add this to your
`load-path'.

Assuming this file is also in your `load-path' somewhere, you
want to (require 'wikiarea) in your ~/.emacs or some such. Now,
M-x wikiarea RET should pull up a *WikiArea* buffer in which a
list of files should appear. Hitting RET on a new or updated
file will download it to your `wikiarea-managed-directory',
while hitting RET on an up-to-date file will visit it (if it
exists). C-u RET will always download a new copy of the file.

You might want to seed your `wikiarea-managed-directory' by
grabbing the Elisp area tarball from:
	      http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp.tar.gz

The code uses a cache of the last file info from the website
instead of looking at your files' modification times. It should
probably do the latter. It also relies on Alex's current HTML
formatting, as well as his most excellent `http-get.el', also
available in the wiki's lisp area. Thanks to Tom Pierce
<tom@pierceport.com> for the patch adding `http-get.el' support
& other enhancements.")

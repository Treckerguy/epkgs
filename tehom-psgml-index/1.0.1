 :commentary "\
This code is intended to make it easier to create and maintain
tables of contents of html files.  It's potentially extendable to
other SGML and XML files.

It's fairly slow, because it does a lot of redundant parsing.
However, that was neccessary in order to edit the buffer and keep
elements' positions meaningful in a simple way.")

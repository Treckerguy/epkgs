To use this module: Load this file, open a ledger data file, and
type M-x ledger-mode.  Once this is done, you can type:

  C-c C-a       add a new entry, based on previous entries
  C-c C-e       toggle cleared status of an entry
  C-c C-y       set default year for entry mode
  C-c C-m       set default month for entry mode
  C-c C-r       reconcile uncleared entries related to an account
  C-c C-o C-r   run a ledger report
  C-C C-o C-g   goto the ledger report buffer
  C-c C-o C-e   edit the defined ledger reports
  C-c C-o C-s   save a report definition based on the current report
  C-c C-o C-a   rerun a ledger report
  C-c C-o C-k   kill the ledger report buffer

In the reconcile buffer, use SPACE to toggle the cleared status of
a transaction, C-x C-s to save changes (to the ledger file as
well).

The ledger reports command asks the user to select a report to run
then creates a report buffer containing the results of running the
associated command line.  Its' behavior is modified by a prefix
argument which, when given, causes the generated command line that
will be used to create the report to be presented for editing
before the report is actually run.  Arbitrary unnamed command lines
can be run by specifying an empty name for the report.  The command
line used can later be named and saved for future use as a named
report from the generated reports buffer.

In a report buffer, the following keys are available:
  (space)  scroll up
  e        edit the defined ledger reports
  s        save a report definition based on the current report
  q        quit the report (return to ledger buffer)
  r        redo the report
  k        kill the report buffer")

Defines the mode `file-name-shadow-mode'.

The `read-file-name' function passes its result through
`substitute-in-file-name', so any part of the string preceding
multiple slashes (or a drive indicator on MS-DOS/MS-Windows) is
ignored.

If `file-name-shadow-mode' is active, any part of the
minibuffer text that would be ignored because of this is given the
properties in `file-name-shadow-properties', which may
be used to make the ignored text invisible, dim, etc.")

 :commentary "\
Here  is  another two-pane mc emulation layer for emacs. It's built on top of
Dired and takes advantage of all its features, offering at the same time  the
double  pane  interface I'd been missing so badly since I started using regu-
larly emacs (for everything!). I tried  both  Ilya  Zakharevich's  nc.el  and
Kevin  Burton's  mc.el,  but  none of them was what I was looking for (though
mc.el was near the ideal).

A  lot  of  this code was once adapted from Kevin's mc.el, but it has evolved
quite a bit since then. Another part (the code for file copying and renaming)
derives originally from the dired extensions written by Kurt Nørmark for LAML
(http://www.cs.aau.dk/~normark/scheme/distribution/laml/).

I have added to the mix several useful functions:

*  Sunrise  is  implemented  as a derived major mode confined inside the pane
buffers, so its buffers and dired ones can live together without easymenu  or
viper to avoid key binding collisions.

*  It  automatically  closes unused buffers and tries to never keep open more
than the one or two used to display the panes.

*  Each pane has its own history ring: press M-y / M-u for moving backwards /
forwards in the history of directories.

* Press M-t to swap (transpose) the panes.

* Press C-= for \"smart\" file comparison using ediff. It compares together the
first two files marked on each pane or, if no files have been marked, it  as-
sumes that the second pane contains a file with the same name as the selected
one and tries to compare these two. You can also mark whole lists of files to
be compared and then just press C-= for comparing the next pair.

*  Press  = for fast \"smart\" file comparison -- like above, but using regular
diff.

* Press C-M-= for directory comparison (by date / size / contents of files).

* Press C-c C-s to change the layout of the panes (horizontal/vertical/top)

* Press C-c / to interactively refine  the contents of the current pane using
fuzzy (a.k.a. flex) matching, then:
   - press Delete or Backspace to revert the buffer to its previous state
   - press Return, C-n or C-p to exit and accept the current narrowed state
   - press Esc or C-g to abort the operation and revert the buffer
   - use ! to prefix characters that should NOT appear after a given position
Once narrowed and accepted, you can restore the original contents of the pane
by pressing g (revert-buffer).

*  Press  C-x C-q   to put the current pane in Editable Dired mode (allows to
edit the pane as if it were a regular file -- press C-c C-c  to  commit  your
changes to the filesystem, or C-c C-k to abort).

* Press y to recursively calculate the total size (in bytes) of all files and
directories currently selected/marked in the active pane.

*  Sunrise VIRTUAL mode integrates dired-virtual mode to Sunrise, allowing to
capture find and locate results in regular files and to use them later as  if
they  were  directories  with  all  Dired  and  Sunrise  operations  at  your
fingertips.
The results of the following operations are displayed in VIRTUAL mode:
   - find-dired-name (press C-c C-n),
   - find-grep-name  (press C-c C-g),
   - find-dired      (press C-c C-f),
   - locate          (press C-c C-l),
   - list all recently visited files (press C-c C-r -- requires recentf),
   - list all directories in active pane's history ring (press C-c C-d).

* Supports AVFS (http://www.inf.bme.hu/~mszeredi/avfs/) for transparent navi-
gation inside compressed archives (*.zip, *.tgz, *.tar.bz2, *.deb, etc. etc.)
You  need to have AVFS with coda or fuse installed and running on your system
for this to work, though.

* Opening terminals directly from Sunrise:
   - Press C-c C-t to inconditionally open a new terminal into the currently
     selected directory in the active pane.
   - Press C-c t to switch to the last opened terminal.
   - Press C-c T to switch to the last opened terminal and change directory
     to the one in the current directory.

*  Terminal  integration  and Command line expansion: integrates tightly with
eshell or term-mode to allow interaction between terminal emulators  in  line
mode  (C-c  C-j)  and  the panes: the most important navigation commands (up,
down, mark, unmark, go to parent dir) can be  executed  on  the  active  pane
directly  from  the  terminal  by  pressing the usual keys with Meta: <M-up>,
<M-down>,  etc.  Additionally,  the following substitutions are automagically
performed in term-line-mode:
    %f - expands to the currently selected file in the left pane
    %F - expands to the currently selected file in the right pane
    %m - expands to the list of paths of all marked files in the left pane
    %M - expands to the list of paths of all marked files in the right pane
    %n - expands to the list of names of all marked files in the left pane
    %N - expands to the list of names of all marked files in the right pane
    %d - expands to the current directory in the left pane
    %D - expands to the current directory in the right pane

*  Cloning  of  complete directory trees: press K to clone the selected files
and directories into the passive pane. Cloning is a  more  general  operation
than  copying, in which all directories are recursively created with the same
names and structures at the destination, while  what  happens  to  the  files
within them depends on the option you choose:
   - \"(D)irectories only\" ignores all files, copies only directories,
   - \"(C)opies\" performs a regular recursive copy of all files and dirs,
   - \"(H)ardlinks\" makes every new file a (hard) link to the original one
   - \"(S)ymlinks\" creates absolute symbolic links for all files in the tree,
   - \"(R)elative symlinks” creates relative symbolic links.

* Passive navigation: the usual navigation keys (n, p, Return, U, ;) combined
with Meta allow to move across the passive pane without  actually  having  to
switch to it.

* Synchronized navigation:  press  C-c C-z  to enable / disable  synchronized
navigation. In this mode, the passive navigation keys  (M-n,  M-p,  M-Return,
etc.)  operate on both panes simultaneously. I've found this quite useful for
comparing hierarchically small to medium-sized directory trees (for large  to
very  large  directory  trees  one  needs  something  on the lines of diff -r
though).

* Sticky search: press C-c s to launch an interactive search that will remain
active from directory to directory, until you hit a regular file or press C-g
to abort the operation.

* etc. ;-)

It  doesn't  even  try to look like MC, so the help window is gone (you're in
emacs, so you know your bindings, right?), though if you really  miss it just
get and install the sunrise-x-buttons extension.

This is version 4 $Rev: 344 $ of the Sunrise Commander.

It  was  written  on GNU Emacs 23 on Linux, and tested on GNU Emacs 22 and 23
for Linux and on EmacsW32 (version 23) for  Windows.  I  have  also  received
feedback  from a user reporting it works OK on the Mac (GNU Emacs 22.2 on Mac
OS X Leopard). I *am* aware that  there  are  several  functions  (including,
alas,  file  and directory comparison) that simply will not work on GNU Emacs
21, but unfortunately I do not have the time to port them  back.  It  doesn't
work  either  on  XEmacs  --  please drop me a line if you would like to help
porting it. All contributions and/or bug reports will be very welcome.

For more details on the file manager, extensions and cool tips & tricks visit
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Sunrise_Commander

Installation and Usage:

1) Put this file somewhere in your emacs load-path.

2) Add a (require 'sunrise-commander) to your .emacs file.

3)  Choose  some  unused  extension for files to be opened in Sunrise VIRTUAL
mode and add it to auto-mode-alist, e.g. if you want  to  name  your  virtual
directories  like  *.svrm  just  add  to  your  .emacs  file  a line like the
following:

    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.srvm\\\\'\" . sr-virtual-mode))

4) Evaluate the new lines, or reload your .emacs file, or restart emacs.

5) Type M-x sunrise to invoke the Sunrise Commander (or much better: bind the
function to your favorite key combination). The  command  sunrise-cd  invokes
Sunrise  and  automatically  selects  the  current file wherever it is in the
filesystem. Type h at any moment for information on available key bindings.

6)  Type  M-x customize-group <RET> sunrise <RET> to customize options, fonts
and colors (activate AVFS support here, too).

7) Enjoy :)")

 :commentary "\
This package provide the function `w32-exec-predef' which can be
used to execute shortcuts from the Start Menu in Windows, using
iswitchb completion. This is yet another step in avoiding to leave
the safe environment living inside Emacs... :)

The user does not need to keep this list updated himself as there
is a function, `w32-exec-predef-build', that does it for him. This,
however, means that the first time in each session that the
function is run, it will take a bit longer because it will populate
all information from the Start Menu.

Prerequisites:

* requires findr.el for doing the recursive scan for .lnk files and
  w32-utl.el for some utility functions.")

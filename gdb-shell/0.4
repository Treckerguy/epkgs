 :commentary "\
This minor mode will recognize various commands in shell mode and
take one of two actions.  For \"build\" commands (currently make,
valgrind, and ant), it will enable compilation-shell-minor-mode.
For \"gdb\", it will invoke Emacs' built-in gdb rather than running
it in the shell buffer.  This is especially handy if you use
\"gdb --args\".")

THIS PACKAGE IS NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED.

`jasmin.el' is an Emacs major mode for editing Jasmin Java bytecode
assembler files.

Major features are:

  * Indenting, with a little non-indenting formatting thrown in.

  * Font-lock fontifying.  (If you find this to be too slow, set
    `jasmin-fontify-instructions' to nil.)

  * Quick-reference help on instructions and directives.

The absolute easiest way to install this if you're not yet an Emacs weenie
is to copy this file to some directory (say, `/home/joebob/emacs/'), and put
something like the following in your `.emacs' file:

    (load \"/home/joebob/emacs/jasmin.el\")

As you might suspect, the easiest way isn't the best way, but this'll get
you by if you're in a hurry.

This package was tested with GNU Emacs 19.31, and should work with any
recent version.  It'll probably work with the prodigal XEmacs too.

writing, the Java VM book Meyer co-authored with Troy Downing
(O'Reilly&Associates, ISBN 1-56592-194-1) has not yet been published.  Sun
also has a Java VM book due out any day now (Sun/Addison-Wesley).")

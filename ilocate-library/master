This package consists of functions to replace
`locate-library' and `load-library' with interactive
versions that do minibuffer completion.

entry points:
  ilocate-library :
     locate library in load-path
  ilocate-library-find-source :
     locate library, and read the source (.el),
     if it's available, into a new buffer in
     the other window
  ilocate-load-library :
     interactive load-library with completion

All functions use a cached table of libraries found in the
`load-path'.  The table, `ilocate-library-cache', is
generated the first time any of these functions are
called, or if the `load-path' has changed since the last
invocation of the function.  You may force the refreshing
of the cache by calling any of the functions with a
prefix arg.")

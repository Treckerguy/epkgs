This is modelled after characters.el.  At the moment, however, we
don't have categories assigned, so we must create them ourselves.
The new categories are identified by a character, like all other
categories.  We store them in the following variables.

The existing categories and syntax tables are not enough to resolve
bidi issues: Some of these categories specify that the \"real\"
category must be determined from context.  See the Unicode Standard
Annex #9, available from http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr9/.")

The `M-x archie' command will connect to an archie server and send
a search request.  It'll return control to the user immediately,
and a window with the search results will be popped up when the
results have arrived.

You can do several concurrent searches using different servers, but
you can only have one outstanding request to each server at a time.

Put the following in your .emacs:

 (autoload 'archie \"archie\" nil t)")

I was annoyed that when splitting windows the same buffer shows up in the
new window.  It also happens when quitting help.  So I made this.


Some notes for the author:

`split-window-*' all call `split-window'

`bury-buffer' calls `switch-to-prev-buffer'

`quit-window' calls `switch-to-prev-buffer', but also has a separate
  code-path that restores directly from window parameter `quit-restore'

`kill-buffer' calls first kills the buffer, then calls
`replace-buffer-in-windows' to scrub the buffer from other windows.
`kill-buffer' has to be adviced to make the replace buffer unique.


`replace-buffer-in-windows' calls `switch-to-prev-buffer'


So advice functions `switch-to-prev-buffer' `quit-window' `split-window'

 :commentary "\
Common window managers in Un*x usually implement several focus
policies. Besides the common but awfull (IMHO) click-to-focus there
is also a focus follows mouse mode which means that the window
under the mouse pointer receives the keyboard presses.

A friend of mine wanted this for (X)Emacs, too and so here it is. I
don't use it, though, because I stick with the keys when inside
XEmacs. 

Installation
Put into your init file (~/.emacs or ~/.xemacs/init.el):
(require 'mouse-focus)
(turn-on-mouse-focus)

Bugs:
Doesn't work in GNU Emacs and since I have no knowledge about it's
mouse handling system I probably won't adress this problem (even
more since I don't use this package myself)

ChangeLog
 2009-07-24, v1.1: apply minor change by Gabriel Knoy which fixes
 behaviour with minibuffer.")

 :commentary "\
This is is a MUSH or MUD client.  Instead of using telnet or
standalone client to connect to your favorite MUSH or MUD, you can
use mu.el to play within Emacs.

I used to play using tinymud.el, but decided to rewrite it based on
comint-mode.  :)

Before playing, customize `mu-worlds'.  Then use `mu-open' to open a
connection to one of the worlds.  This will automaticall create a mu
connection buffer and a mu buffer.  You can type commands in either
buffer and send them to the host with RET.  The output will be in the
mu connection buffer.

If you load ansi-color.el, you should be able to get ANSI colors.")

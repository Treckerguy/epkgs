 :commentary "\
gather.el provides search regexp and kill text. This is not replacing
nor modifying Emacs `kill-ring' mechanism.
Have similar concept of `occur'. If I think `occur' have line oriented 
feature, gather.el have list oriented feature. You can handle the list,
as long as you can handle Emacs-Lisp list object.")

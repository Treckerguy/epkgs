 :commentary "\
The Smart Common Input Method platform (SCIM) is an input
method (IM) platform containing support for more than thirty
languages (CJK and many European languages) for POSIX-style
operating systems including Linux and BSD.

scim-bridge.el is a SCIM-Bridge client for Emacs. This program
allows users on-the-spot style input with SCIM. The input statuses
are individually kept for each buffer, and prefix-keys such as C-x
and C-c can be used even if SCIM is active. So you can input
various languages fast and comfortably by using it.

This program is *not* a part of SCIM-Bridge.


Installation:

First, save this file as scim-bridge.el and byte-compile in
a directory that is listed in load-path.

Put the following in your .emacs file:

  (require 'scim-bridge)
  (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'scim-mode-on)

To disable XIM in Emacs, put the following in ~/.Xresources:

  Emacs*useXIM: false

and restart X session or execute a shell command:

  xrdb ~/.Xresources


Here is the example of settings in .emacs:

  (require 'scim-bridge)
  ;; Turn on scim-mode automatically after loading .emacs
  (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'scim-mode-on)
  ;; Use C-SPC for Set Mark command
  (scim-define-common-key ?\\C-\\s nil)
  ;; Use C-/ for Undo command
  (scim-define-common-key ?\\C-/ nil)
  ;; Change cursor color depending on SCIM status
  (setq scim-cursor-color '(\"red\" \"blue\" \"limegreen\"))


Note that this program requires GNU Emacs 22 or later, and
works only when Emacs is running under X session.")

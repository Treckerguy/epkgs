This is a backend implementation for the completion package
company-mode by Nikolaj Schumacher. More info about this package
is available at http://nschum.de/src/emacs/company-mode
Company-mode is also available at the ELPA http://tromey.com/elpa

The backend is installed into the list of company-backends, but
you have to enable company-mode manually (or in lisp-mode-hook).

Installation:

Add this to your .emacs:

  (add-to-list 'load-path \"<directory-of-this-file>\")
  (add-hook 'slime-load-hook (lambda () (require 'slime-company)))

or use:

  (slime-setup 'slime-fancy 'slime-company)

For the completion to work, you need to enable company mode in
slime and set the appropriate company backends. This can be done
via a hook function:

  (add-hook 'slime-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (company-mode 1)
              (set (make-local-variable 'company-backends)
                   '(slime-company-backend))))

I also have the following, IMO more convenient key bindings for
company mode in my .emacs:

  (define-key company-active-map (kbd \"\\C-n\") 'company-select-next)
  (define-key company-active-map (kbd \"\\C-p\") 'company-select-previous)
  (define-key company-active-map (kbd \"\\C-d\") 'company-show-doc-buffer)
  (define-key company-active-map (kbd \"\\C-v\") 'company-show-location)
  (define-key company-active-map (kbd \"<tab>\") 'company-complete)
  (define-key company-active-map (kbd \"\\C-g\") '(lambda ()
                                                 (interactive)
                                                 (company-abort)))")

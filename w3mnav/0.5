`w3mnav' kludges some Info-like navigation keys into the `emacs-w3m' Web
browser (`http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/').  This functionality was originally
part of Scheme support package Quack (`http://www.neilvandyke.org/quack/'),
and was intended to work with the numerous Scheme books that were converted
to HTML from LaTeX format.  It also works with some other HTML pages that
have book-like \"next page\" and \"previous page\" links.

To install, put file `w3mnav.el' into one of your Emacs Lisp directories,
optionally byte-compile the file, and add a line like the following to your
`~/.emacs' file:

    (require 'w3mnav)")

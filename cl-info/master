If you'd rather read HyperSpec references very quickly within Emacs, this
module is for you.  It rebinds the meaning of C-h f in lisp-mode buffers to
access the HyperSpec docs, rather than looking up docstrings for Emacs
functions.  Also, it changes the behavior of 'q' in *info* buffers so that
the window goes away on its own.

Dependencies:

This module depends on Info format of Common Lisp HyperSpec, described on
Bill Clementon's blog, at http://bc.tech.coop/blog/031002.html.  The info
pages themselves can be found here:

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gcl/gcl.info.tgz

This package relies on parts of SLIME, so that must be installed already.
Also, don't forget to configure `Info-additional-directory-list' to point
to where you've put the Info pages, unless you installed them in a standard
location.  **If you put them in their own directory**, you're going to need
to make a proper \"dir\" file and put it in that same directory.  That file
should look like this:

<BEGIN>
-*- Text -*-
This is the file .../info/dir, which contains the topmost node of the
Info hierarchy.  The first time you invoke Info you start off
looking at that node, which is (dir)Top.

File: dir	Node: Top	This is the top of the INFO tree
  This (the Directory node) gives a menu of major topics. 
  Typing \"d\" returns here, \"q\" exits, \"?\" lists all INFO commands, \"h\" 
  gives a primer for first-timers, \"mEmacs<Return>\" visits the Emacs topic,
  etc.
  In Emacs, you can click mouse button 2 on a menu item or cross reference
  to select it.
  --- PLEASE ADD DOCUMENTATION TO THIS TREE. (See INFO topic first.) ---

* Menu: The list of major topics begins on the next line.

Common Lisp
* HyperSpec: (gcl).     The Common Lisp HyperSpec.

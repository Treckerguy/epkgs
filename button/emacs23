 :commentary "\
This package defines functions for inserting and manipulating
clickable buttons in Emacs buffers, such as might be used for help
hyperlinks, etc.

In some ways it duplicates functionality also offered by the
`widget' package, but the button package has the advantage that it
is (1) much faster, (2) much smaller, and (3) much, much, simpler
(the code, that is, not the interface).

Buttons can either use overlays, in which case the button is
represented by the overlay itself, or text-properties, in which case
the button is represented by a marker or buffer-position pointing
somewhere in the button.  In the latter case, no markers into the
buffer are retained, which is important for speed if there are are
extremely large numbers of buttons.  Note however that if there is
an existing face text-property at the site of the button, the
button face may not be visible.  Using overlays avoids this.

Using `define-button-type' to define default properties for buttons
is not necessary, but it is is encouraged, since doing so makes the
resulting code clearer and more efficient.")

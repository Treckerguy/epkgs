 :commentary "\
Winner mode is a global minor mode that records the changes in the
window configuration (i.e. how the frames are partitioned into
windows) so that the changes can be \"undone\" using the command
`winner-undo'.  By default this one is bound to the key sequence
ctrl-c left.  If you change your mind (while undoing), you can
press ctrl-c right (calling `winner-redo').  Even though it uses
some features of Emacs20.3, winner.el should also work with
Emacs19.34 and XEmacs20, provided that the installed version of
custom is not obsolete.

Winner mode was improved August 1998.
Further improvements February 2002.")

 :commentary "\
A global minor mode that enables selection of completion methods.
It is a light wrapper around the `completion-ui' package which allows
the completion mechanism to be changed easily either via a keymap or menu
accessible from the menu-bar.

The current completion mechanism is displayed hight-lighted in the mode-line
which can also be clicked on to pop-up the selection menu.

This work relies on the good work of Toby Cubitt on completion-ui and also
his continued help and patience with this work -- thanks.

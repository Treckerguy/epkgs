Set up a list of file-name matching regular expressions associated
with shell commands to run after saving the file.

This is good for things like running `newaliases(1)' on
\"/etc/aliases\", or `xrdb(1)' on \"~/.Xresources\", as well as
sending signals to daemons whos configuration files you've just
finished editting.

It is much safer than using exec statements in \"Local Variables\"
sections, and can safely be used by root for system administration
tasks.  The shell command can run about anything you can think of.

See: `After-save-alist' for more information.")

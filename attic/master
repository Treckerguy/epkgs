** Description

This is a simple package for maintaining time-stamped backups.

This is how it works: If a file was last saved on the 19th of July 2002
and the the current buffer's file is \"~/test\", the command `attic-store'
will save a copy in \"~/.attic/last/\" and in \"~/.attic/020719/\". If the
variable `attic-compress-cmd' is set, the backuped files will be
compressed -- \"gzip\" is used by default. Later you can use the commands
`attic-compare-with-last' and `attic-compare-with-version' to generate
an ediff between the current version and one of the backuped ones.


** Installation & Usage

Put (require 'attic) (attic-install) into your startup/user init file.
Call `attic-store' to make a backup.


** Important commands

`attic-store' :: Save a backup.

`attic-store-special' :: Save an annotated backup.

`attic-compare-with-last' :: Compare the current file with its last
backuped version.

`attic-compare-with-version' :: Compare the current file with a backuped
version.


The important variables are:

`attic-date-format' :: This variable defines if you want to make daily,
weekly, monthly etc. backups.

`attic-compress-cmd' :: Set the command used for compression.

`attic-compress-suffix' :: set the suffix used by `attic-compress-cmd'.

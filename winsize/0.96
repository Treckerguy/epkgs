This file contains functions for interactive resizing of Emacs
windows.  To use it put it in your `load-path' and add the following
to your .emacs:

    (require 'winsize)
    (global-set-key [(control x) ?+] 'resize-windows)

For more information see `resize-windows'.

These functions are a slightly rewritten version of the second part
of the second part my proposal for a new `balance-windows' function
for Emacs 22.  The rewrite is mostly a restructure to more easily
add new functions.  All functions and variables have been renamed.
The file was originally named bw-interactive.el.

New ideas for functionality have been to a large part adopted from
the Emacs Devel mailing list.  Probably most of them originated from
Drew Adams and Bastien.")

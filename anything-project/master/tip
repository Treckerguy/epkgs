 :commentary "\
anything-project.el is pure emacs lisp version of anything-find-project-resources.el.
many ideas from
http://trac.codecheck.in/share/browser/lang/elisp/anything-find-project-resources/trunk/anything-find-project-resources.el
and
http://blog.jrock.us/articles/eproject.POD

Installation:

drop this file into a directory in your `load-path',
and put these lines into your .emacs file.

(require 'anything-project)
(global-set-key (kbd \"C-c C-f\") 'anything-project)

type C-c C-f to invoke anything with project files.
project root directory is automatically detected by anything-project.el

clear cache, If `anything-project' function is called with prefix arg (C-u M-x anything-project)


Configuration:
you can add new project rule by `ap:add-project' function
keywords :look-for, :include-regexp and :exclude-regexp can be regexp or list of regexp
below are few samples

(ap:add-project
 :name 'perl
 :look-for '(\"Makefile.PL\" \"Build.PL\") ; or
 :include-regexp '(\"\\\\.pm$\" \"\\\\.t$\" \"\\\\.pl$\" \"\\\\.PL$\") ;or
 )

(ap:add-project
 :name 'perl
 :look-for '(\"Makefile.PL\" \"Build.PL\")
 :include-regexp '(\"\\\\.pm$\" \"\\\\.t$\" \"\\\\.pl$\" \"\\\\.PL$\")
 :exclude-regexp \"/tmp\" ; can be regexp or list of regexp
 )")

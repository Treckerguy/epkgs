quick-jump.el works like `register' in Emacs. but it is
  different to it ,quick-jump.el push current position to a
  ring named `qj-marker-ring' then you can go back(or forward)
  to the position ,and you can clear all the position in `qj-marker-ring'
  to manager the ring by `quick-jump-clear-all-marker'.

  Suppose you have run `quick-jump-push-marker' on line 1,5,10
  then three positions is pushed into `qj-marker-ring'. now the ring is
  [10,5,1],you  are on line 10 now ,then you run  `quick-jump-go-back'
  you will be back to line 5, the ring still is [10,5,1]. but
  `qj-current-marker' is not the last position you have pushed on line
  10, it's line 5 now.
  go back and go forward are related to `qj-current-marker'.

  when you `quick-jump-go-back' or `quick-jump-go-forward' 
  it will decide whether push current position to `qj-marker-ring'
  automaticly or not . when the count of lines between current line
  and the line of `qj-current-marker' are larger than `qj-line-count',
  then current position will be automaticly put into `qj-marker-ring'

  So suppose the ring is [15,10,5,1] and `qj-current-marker' is 10 ,if you
  are on line 100 now ,and you run `quick-jump-go-back' now you position
  is go back to line 5,the ring become [100,15,10.5.1],because
  100-10>`qj-line-count' it is larger than `qj-line-count' default value
  10.but if you are on line 16 and run `quick-jump-go-back', the ring still
  is [15,10,5,1] ,it isn't [16,15,10,5,1],because 16-10<`qj-line-count'.")

 :commentary "\
This is a propser (http://prosper.sourceforge.net/) style file for
AUCTeX.

Installation: 

For this file to work you need to have a working installation of 
AucTeX. After that installtion is simple. Put this file into one of 
the directories specified in `TeX-style-path', with the name 
\"style\" rather than \"auto\" as it might get over written in the 
latter.  

Then stick the current for into your .emacs 
(eval-after-load \"latex\" 
  '(add-to-list 'LaTeX-style-list '(\"prosper\"))) 


And that should be it. You check whether it's worked or not by 
opening a prosper document, and trying `LaTeX-environment'. \"slide\" 
should be available by tab completion and it should ask you about 
overlays.  

The environment \"prosper\" should be inserted immediately after the
document environment.  It will prompt you for options available
under prosper and create a skeleton document.")

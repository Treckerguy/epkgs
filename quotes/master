Quick Start:

Unzip  the file  Quotes.gz into  ~/.quotes/ (both  of these  are customiz-
able).  Quotes.gz is currently available at:

  ftp://vh213601.truman.edu/pub/Quotes/Quotes.gz

Then load this file, and start quotes with M-x quotes.

More generally, place this file somewhere in your `load-path', and add the
following to your `.emacs' (or otherwise arrange to have it evaluated):

 (autoload 'quotes-mode \"quotes\" \"A mode for keeping quotes.\" t)

 (autoload 'quotes \"quotes\"  \"A command to start quotes.\" t)

The `quotes-mode' description has more information.

This is based on Paul Davis's rolo.el

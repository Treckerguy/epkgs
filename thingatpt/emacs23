This file provides routines for getting the \"thing\" at the location of
point, whatever that \"thing\" happens to be.  The \"thing\" is defined by
its beginning and end positions in the buffer.

The function bounds-of-thing-at-point finds the beginning and end
positions by moving first forward to the end of the \"thing\", and then
backwards to the beginning.  By default, it uses the corresponding
forward-\"thing\" operator (eg. forward-word, forward-line).

Special cases are allowed for using properties associated with the named
\"thing\":

  forward-op		Function to call to skip forward over a \"thing\" (or
                     with a negative argument, backward).

  beginning-op	Function to call to skip to the beginning of a \"thing\".
  end-op		Function to call to skip to the end of a \"thing\".

Reliance on existing operators means that many `things' can be accessed
without further code:  eg.
    (thing-at-point 'line)
    (thing-at-point 'page)")

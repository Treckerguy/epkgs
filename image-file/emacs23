 :commentary "\
Defines a file-name-handler hook that transforms visited (or
inserted) image files so that they are displayed by Emacs as
images.  This is done by putting a `display' text-property on the
image data, with the image-data still present underneath; if the
resulting buffer file is saved to another name it will correctly save
the image data to the new file.")

 :commentary "\
The docstring for the function `type-break-mode' summarizes most of the
details of the interface.

This package relies on the assumption that you live entirely in Emacs,
as the author does.  If that's not the case for you (e.g. you often
suspend Emacs or work in other windows) then this won't help very much;
it will depend on just how often you switch back to Emacs.  At the very
least, you will want to turn off the keystroke thresholds and rest
interval tracking.

If you prefer not to be queried about taking breaks, but instead just
want to be reminded, do the following:

  (setq type-break-query-mode nil)

Or call the command `type-break-query-mode' with a negative prefix
argument.

If you find echo area messages annoying and would prefer to see messages
in the mode line instead, do M-x type-break-mode-line-message-mode
or set the variable of the same name to `t'.

This program can truly cons up a storm because of all the calls to
`current-time' (which always returns 3 fresh conses).  I'm dismayed by
this, but I think the health of my hands is far more important than a
few pages of virtual memory.

This program has no hope of working in Emacs 18.

This package was inspired by Roland McGrath's hanoi-break.el.

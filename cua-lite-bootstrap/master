 :commentary "\
cua-lite is a CUA emulator package for Emacs.  cua-lite-bootstrap
 is a bootstrap program for cua-lite.  Its purpose is to define
 some autoload's for cua-lite, define a hotkey to toggle cua-lite
 on and off, and, optionally, load cua-lite and turn it on.  By
 having this bootstrap file, which has very little resource
 demands, I hope to encourage people to have cua-lite around and
 available for use with as little effort as possible.  It can even
 be included in site files easily enough.

Installation:

 Put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path and add the following to
 your ~/.emacs startup file

    (require 'cua-lite-bootstrap)

 To add a directory to your load-path, use something like the following:

     (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name \"/some/load/path\"))")

 :commentary "\
Provides support for Asm86 assembly editing. The features and
details are discussed in reasonable detail in the major mode
documentation string.

Note that some routines will run faster if the code is byte-compiled
first. The most noticable function is (asm86-tab-region). 

Additional features to add (wish-list):
 * Better EQU formatting (spacing)
 * Macro indenting/formatting
 * Label finding - find a label within the buffer (electric?)
 * Register report - determine which registers are used (altered)
   by an assembly function.")

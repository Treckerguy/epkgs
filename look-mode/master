 :commentary "\
This package provides a function to load a list of files into a
temporary buffer for viewing.  The buffer (*look*) is writable,
so when used with eimp.el (Emacs Image Manipulation Package), one
can resize images without any danger of overwriting the original
file.  This may also be of interest to someone wishing to scan
the files of a directory.

Presently, the file list is generated by a system call to \"ls\" so this
probably is not Windows compatible.  One moves through the file list 
using the keybindings:
           C-. or M-] or M-n (look-at-next-file)
           C-, or M-[ or M-p (look-at-previous-file)

After loading, M-l is bound to \"look-at-files\" from dired

C-c l should access the Customize interface for the \"look\" group.")

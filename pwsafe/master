pwsafe.el provides an Emacs interface for pwsafe:
http://nsd.dyndns.org/pwsafe, http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net
On a debian or ubuntu system, just use: apt-get install pwsafe
to install pwsafe

The latest version of pwsafe.el can be found at:
http://www.xsteve.at/prg/emacs/

Usage:
put the following in your .emacs:
(require 'pwsafe)
Then run M-x pwsafe
- if the password database file does not yet exist it will be created now
- otherwise a list of nicknames for your stored passwords is shown

Important commands:
a: Add a new entry to the pwsafe database (see: pwsafe-primary-database)

U: copy the user name for the entry at point
P: copy the password for the entry at point
B: copy the user name and then the password for the entry at point

s u: First select an entry via ido, then perform the action as described above
s p: \"
s b: \"

Note: If ido does not work, try to initialize it like this:
(when (require 'ido \"ido\" t)
  (ido-mode 'buffer))

It is also possible to feed passwords from the pwsafe database
when emacs asks for a password. This is done by advising the read-password function
See the documentation for the variable pwsafe-feed-read-passwd-rules for details

I am very interested in feedback about the usability and about
security concerns for this package

Before using pwsafe.el, I used a simple unencrypted text file
for my passwords. So this package enhances the security for my use case.")

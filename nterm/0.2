Disclaimer: nterm is *alpha* software. It will blow up. Don't blame
me, I warned you! A good terminal emulator architecture has display
memory and a table of functions for each character coming in. I
have been int the terminal emulation business for seven years so I
ought to know.

Nterm is meant to be a full vt100 compatible terminal emulator. It
has the following features:

 - G0 G1 switching with shift in and shift out
 - special graphics characters (used for line drawing)
 - blinking, bright, underline and reverse rendition
 - scroll up and down including within top and bottom margin
 - switch terminal background color
 - switch between 80 and 132 columns screen
 - tabulation set and reset
 - all VT100 escape sequences are handled
 - Double width character
 - Double height character

Things that remains to be done:
- fix line drawing single width characters
- bind C-c C-c to interrupt
- fix slow crolling
- fix buffer popping when changing cursor position
- US and UK character set.
- ANSI color
- VT52 compatibility mode
- Copy and paste mechanism
- xterm emulator
- Directory tracking
- Handle multiple instance
- Look for TBD in this file for other things...

I think nterm is easier to maintain than term. One look at term's
term-emulate-terminal function should convince anyone that term
cannot be maintained anymore. Compare with nterm equivalent
function nterm-emulate it is only 25 lines long.

It has a recording mode (f11) so that you can record and replay
traces. It has a terminal memory so that area of the terminal can
be redrawn for blinking and changing screen background. There is a
memory dump mode (f10) that allows the programmer to examine the
memory.

The recorder takes a trace of characters received by the
terminal. Someone can easily reproduce a bug by replaying the trace
both on xterm and nterm.

It's not complete yet but it passes the first three tests of
vttest. I will get back to it when I have time.

FAQ
Q: You say \"US and UK character set.\".  That doesn't mean
users can't choose, say, utf-8?
A: Nope, it's vt100 character set, 8 bit character are just ignored
for now")

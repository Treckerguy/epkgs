 :commentary "\
This is a \"rainbow parentheses\" mode which includes support for
parens \"()\", brackets \"[]\", and braces \"{}\". It conveys nesting
depth by using a different face for each level.  It colors all
statements at a given level using the same color - if several
statements are all at the same nested depth, they will all be the
same color.

Great care has been taken to make this mode FAST. You should see no
discernible change in scrolling or editing speed while using it,
even with delimiter-rich languages like Clojure, Lisp, and Scheme.

The one exception is with extremely large nested data structures
having hundreds of delimiters; in that case there will be a brief
pause to colorize the structure the very first time it is displayed
on screen; from then on editing this structure will perform at full
speed.

Default colors have been chosen with the philosophy that it's
better be less intrusive than to be more colorful. Color schemes
are always a matter of taste.  If you do take the time to design a
new color scheme, please post it on the EmacsWiki page!

Installation:

1. Place rainbow-delimiters.el on your emacs load-path.

2. Compile the file (necessary for speed):
M-x byte-compile-file <location of rainbow-delimiters.el>

3. Add the following to your dot-emacs/init file:
(require 'rainbow-delimiters)

4. Add hooks for modes where you want it enabled, for example:
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)

- To activate rainbow-delimiters mode temporarily in a buffer:
M-x rainbow-delimiters-mode

Customization:

To customize various options, including the color scheme:
M-x customize-group rainbow-delimiters

color-theme.el users:
If you use the color-theme package, you can specify custom colors
by adding the appropriate faces to your theme.
- Faces take the form of:
  'rainbow-delimiters-depth-#-face' with # being the depth.
  Depth begins at 1, the outermost color.
  Faces exist for depths 1-12.
- The unmatched delimiter face is:
  'rainbow-delimiters-unmatched-delimiter-face'")

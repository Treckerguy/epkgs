 :commentary "\
This is a \"rainbow parentheses\" mode which includes support for
parens \"()\", brackets \"[]\", and braces \"{}\". It conveys nesting depth
by using a different color for each successive nested set of
delimiters. It highlights all statements at a given level using the
same color - if several statements are all at the same depth, they
will all be the same color.

Great care has been taken to make this mode FAST. You should see no
discernible change in scrolling or editing speed while using it,
even with delimiter-rich languages like Clojure, Lisp, and Scheme.

The ultimate goal for the mode is to be useful with a wide variety
of programming languages with optional semantics catered to each.

Default colors are subtle, with the philosophy that it's better to
avoid being visually intrusive. Color schemes are always a matter of
taste.  If you take the time to design a new color scheme, please
share it (a plain-text list of colors is fine) on the EmacsWiki page!

Installation:

1. Place rainbow-delimiters.el on your emacs load-path.

2. Compile the file (necessary for speed):
M-x byte-compile-file <location of rainbow-delimiters.el>

3. Add the following to your dot-emacs/init file:
(require 'rainbow-delimiters)

4. Add hooks for modes where you want it enabled, for example:
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)

- To activate rainbow-delimiters mode temporarily in a buffer:
M-x rainbow-delimiters-mode

5. When using a dark background, if delimiter colors seem washed out
  you may need to add the following to your dot-emacs and restart:
(setq-default frame-background-mode 'dark)

This is because Emacs can guess frame-background-mode incorrectly,
causing rainbow-delimiters to use its light color scheme on dark
backgrounds.

The light/dark color schemes differ only in their brightness level.

Customization:

To customize various options, including the color scheme:
M-x customize-group rainbow-delimiters

color-theme.el users:
If you use the color-theme package, you can specify custom colors
by adding the appropriate faces to your theme.
- Faces take the form of:
  'rainbow-delimiters-depth-#-face' with # being the depth.
  Depth begins at 1, the outermost color.
  Faces exist for depths 1-9.
- The unmatched delimiter face (normally colored red) is:
  'rainbow-delimiters-unmatched-face'")

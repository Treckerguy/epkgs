 :commentary "\
This is a \"rainbow parentheses\" mode which includes support for
parens \"()\", brackets \"[]\", and braces \"{}\". It conveys nesting
depth by using a different face for each level. It correctly
colorizes statements of the same depth - if two statements are the
same level, they will be the same color.

Great care has been taken to make this mode FAST. You should see
no discernable change in scrolling or editing speed when using it
with delimiter-rich languages such as Clojure, Lisp and Scheme.

The only exception is with extremely large nested data structures
having hundreds of delimiters; in that case there will be a brief
pause to colorize the structure the very first time it is
displayed on screen; from then on editing this structure will
perform at full speed.

Default colors have been chosen with the philosophy that it's
better to err on the side of less intrusion than to be more
colorful. Color schemes are always a matter of taste.
If you do take the time to design a new color scheme,
Please send it in! (jeremy.rayman@gmail.com)

NOTE:
Help would be appreciated in improving the default color scheme.
Since Emacs does not currently have color correction, colors
appear differently wide gamut displays compared to how they look
on most SRGB monitors. I use a wide-gamut display; I have tried
to select the best default colors I can from popular SRGB themes.
If you make a change to the default color scheme, please send it
to (Jeremy Rayman, jeremy.rayman.public@gmail.com).  A list of
colors in any form would be fine; a proper patch is not required.
This would be a useful contribution.")

 :commentary "\
This library provides a 'BiDified' mirror of the current
buffer, using an external program such as 'fribidi' (although
for paragraph mode, you might want to switch that to
bidiv). Use 
(autoload 'poor-mans-bidi-mode \"poor-mans-bidi\" \"\" t)
to have this code autoloaded.
See the documentation for `poor-mans-bidi-mode' for more
information.")

Here is my preliminary configuration and stroke library for using
Emacs with a touchscreen. See strokes.el in Emacs for details on
the recognition. 

See this video for a demo of the gestures:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw8SQqmHPbI

The gestures are in gesture-library.el. Strokes-mode will read
gestures to / write gestures from ~/.strokes by default; I use the
folowing settings:

(setq strokes-file \"~/emacs-gestures/gesture-library.el\")

Once you tell Strokes where gesture-library.el is, do this: 

(gestures-setup)

Unfortunately some of the gestures in the file map to functions
that are specific to my setup, but the main ones should work. 

TODO allow a standard gestures library plus a user-local file to be used
TODO Draw the gestures for the user so they know what to draw?
TODO find out why strokes-mode sometimes obliterate random buffers (!!)
TODO fix mouse behavior and requiring mouse-3 to finish defining stroke
TODO why strokes-mode and desktop-mode are a bad combo?
TODO define more gestures as a community effort to gesture-enable emacs
TODO probably standardize on larger than 9x9 grid---redo gestures :(")

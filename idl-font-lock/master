 :commentary "\
This file provides the data that Font Lock Mode needs in order to decorate
OMG IDL (a.k.a. CORBA IDL) files.  The Font Lock patterns will match and
highlight all of the OMG IDL keywords and types defined in the CORBA 2.4.2
specification.  There are also patterns for highlighting operation names,
attribute names, case clauses, and preprocessor directives.

If you do not know what Font Lock Mode is, this file will not help you ---
you will have to look elsewhere if you want to learn about Font Lock itself.
Similarly, this file does not define a major mode for editing OMG IDL files.
If you need IDL Mode, get the CC Mode package, version 5, from the World
Wide Web at <http://cc-mode.sourceforge.net/>.

Once you have configured Font Lock Mode and installed CC Mode version 5, you
can load this file in order to get highlighting in IDL Mode buffers.  Put
this file where Emacs can find it (i.e., somewhere in your `load-path') and
then add the following lines to your `.emacs' file:

  (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '(\"\\\\.idl\\\\'\" . idl-mode) auto-mode-alist))
  (require 'idl-font-lock)

The patterns for highlighting C preprocessor directives were adapted from
those in the `font-lock.el' file distributed with XEmacs 20.3.  Hence the
long copyright notice at the top of this file.

This package has been tested with XEmacs 21.1.14 and CC Mode 5.28.  Note
that older versions of CC Mode (e.g., version 5.25) have problems indenting
some of the newer (CORBA 2.3+) OMG IDL syntax.")

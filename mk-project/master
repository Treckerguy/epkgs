 :commentary "\
Quickly switch between projects and perform operations on a
per-project basis. A 'project' in this sense is a directory of
related files, usually a directory of source files. Projects are
defined in pure elisp with the 'project-def' function. No
mk-project-specific files are required in the project's base
directory.

If this program doesn't run, I might change the program for the
worse.  So please send mail to akihisa@mail.ne.jp .

This elisp is the extention of moccur.el.
Thanks to the authors for writing moccur.el

With color-moccur, you can search a regexp in all buffers. And you
can search files like grep(-find) without grep (and find) command.

Motivation
moccur is a major mode modelled after the 'Occur' mode of the
standard distribution. It is quite nice to use when you need to
work with a lot of buffers.

Incompatibilites to Occur mode:
a) it browses through *all* buffers that have a file name
associated with them; those may or may not include the current
buffer. Especially, while standard occur works
on 'all lines following point', Moccur does not.
b) there is no support for the 'NLINE' argument.")

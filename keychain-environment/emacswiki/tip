Designed for use with Keychain, see:
(http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/keychain/) a tool for loading the
SSH Agent and keeping it running and accessible on a machine for
longer than a single login seession.

This library loads the file \"$HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh\" and parses it for
the SSH_AUTH_SOCK, SSH_AUTH_PID and GPG_AGENT_INFO variables, placing these
into the environment of Emacs.

This is useful for situations where you are running Emacs under X, not
directly from a terminal, and its inheriting its environment from the
window manager, which doesn't have these variables as you started keychain
after you logged in (say as part of your .bashrc)

The function (refresh-keychain-environment) can also be run at any time
these variables change.

Installation:
Put the file in your load-path then use:

  (require 'keychain-environment)
  (eval-after-load \"keychain-environment\" '(refresh-keychain-environment))

If you want to customise the location of the keychain file then use this:

  (setq keychain-environment-file \"~/path-to-file\")")

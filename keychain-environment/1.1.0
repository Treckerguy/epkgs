Designed for use with Keychain (see:
http://docs.funtoo.org/wiki/Keychain) a tool for loading the SSH
Agent and keeping it running and accessible on a machine for longer
than a single login seession.

This library loads the file \"$HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh\" and parses it for
the SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AUTH_PID variables.

It also checks \"$HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh-gpg\" for the
GPG_AGENT_INFO variable, placing these into the environment of
Emacs.  If these files are empty, or the variables can't be parsed
out of them it doesn't replace existing environment variables.

This is useful for situations where you are running Emacs under X, not
directly from a terminal, and its inheriting its environment from the
window manager, which doesn't have these variables as you started keychain
after you logged in (say as part of your .bashrc)

The function (keychain-refresh-environment) can also be run at any time
these variables change.

Installation:
Put the file in your load-path then use:

  (require 'keychain-environment)
  (keychain-refresh-environment)

If you want to customise the location of the keychain file then use:

  M-x customize-group
  keychain")

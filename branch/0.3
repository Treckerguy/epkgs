This minor mode assists working with multiple branches of a project.
It provides a menu (Branch) which has entries to find or compare against the
version of the current file in other branches.  Multiple projects are
supported, each with different branch structures

To use, first define the branches of the projects you want to use.
This can be done using customize (M-x customize-group RET branch RET) or by
setting the variable branch-index directly within your .emacs.
Each project is a list containing name, a root path and branches.
Each branch is a cons cell of name and a path relative to the root. E.g:
 \"Project A\" in ~/work/project-A with branches:
   \"Development\" in head,
   \"Version 1\" in v1
 \"Project B\" in /somedir/devel/projB with branches:
   \"Branch 2\" in branches/2,
   \"Branch 1\" in branches/1
   \"Version 1.1\" in releases/1.1
would be set with:
(setq branch-index '((\"Project A\" \"~/work/project-A\"
                      ((\"Development\" . \"head\")
                       (\"Version 1\"   . \"v1\")))
                     (\"Project B\" \"/somedir/devel/projB\"
                      ((\"Branch 2\"    . \"branches/2\")
                       (\"Branch 1\"    . \"branches/1\")
                       (\"Version 1.1\" . \"releases/1.1\")))))

To enable branch mode when opening a file, add branch-mode-find-file-hook
to find-file-hook by placing the following in your .emacs:
  (add-hook 'find-file-hooks 'branch-mode-find-file-hook)
or call branch-mode to toggle it on or off.")

This package implements tempbuf-mode, a minor mode that enables
buffers to get automatically deleted in the background when it can
be deduced that they are no longer of any use.

It could be common for example to apply this mode to dired-mode
buffers or read-only buffers visiting files, relieving you from
having to delete each of them manually when the buffer list grows
too large.

The algorithm employed increases the life expectancy of the most
used buffers, even if their usage is intermittent.  A buffer is
considered to be in use if interactive commands are being executed
on it or if it is being displayed in some window.
Buffers visiting files with unsaved content or with active
processes will not get automatically deleted, but you can override
this behavior by customizing tempbuf-expire-hook.

To turn on this mode on dired buffers, put this line in your .emacs:

    (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'turn-on-tempbuf-mode)

I find it also very convenient to turn on this mode in emacs
customization buffers, W3 (Emacs' Web Browser) buffers, UNIX 'man'
documentation buffers, and any buffer with view-mode activated.

    (add-hook 'custom-mode-hook 'turn-on-tempbuf-mode)
    (add-hook 'w3-mode-hook 'turn-on-tempbuf-mode)
    (add-hook 'Man-mode-hook 'turn-on-tempbuf-mode)
    (add-hook 'view-mode-hook 'turn-on-tempbuf-mode)

It may also be reasonable to activate it by default on any visited
file buffer (buffers with unsaved content will not get automatically
deleted, anyway):

    (add-hook 'find-file-hooks 'turn-on-tempbuf-mode)

You can set up things to make tempbuf-mode terminate idle
terminals:

(defun my-term-on-tempbuf-expire ()
  (when (get-buffer-process (current-buffer))
    (term-send-eof)))
(defun my-term-mode-patch ()
  (turn-on-tempbuf-mode)
  (add-hook 'tempbuf-expire-hook 'my-term-on-tempbuf-kill nil t))
(add-hook 'term-mode-hook 'my-term-mode-patch)

This way, a terminal emulator buffer will start receiving
periodic end-of-file signals if it does not seem to get any more
attention from the user, causing it to terminate if there is no
pending command (assuming that a well behaving shell is running on
that terminal).

I plan to release new versions in the following locations:
- http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?TempbufMode
- the gnu.emacs.sources newsgroup")

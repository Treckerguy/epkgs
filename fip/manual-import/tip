This package offers you a function `fip' which pop up a new buffer
with songs that are played on FIP (a french radio I used to listen,
for details see
<URL:http://www.radio-france.fr/chaines/fip/direct/>).

I think that it is a really \"personnal\" package but I wanted to
provide it just in case...

To install:
   0. Install the url package
   1. Put this file in your `load-path'
   2. Put (require 'fip) in your .emacs
   3. M-x fip")

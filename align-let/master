 :commentary "\
This is a spot of code for aligning the values in a \"let\" form.  See
examples in the docstring below.  It's designed for elisp and scheme but
probably works with other lisp variants.

The regexp-based align.el might be able to do the same as the code below,
but it seemed to hard to get lisp nesting recognised properly.

Designed for Emacs 21, works with XEmacs 21 too.")

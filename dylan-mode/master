 :commentary "\
Dylan mode is a major mode for editing Dylan programs. It provides
indenting and font-lock support.

Bug reports should be sent to <gd-bugs@gwydiondylan.org>; questions,
comments and suggestions are welcome at <gd-hackers@gwydiondylan.org>.
Also, see http://www.gwydiondylan.org/ for updates and documentation. 

Known limitations:
  Limited support for block (i.e. \"/*\") comments
    TAB indentation doesn't work within \"/*\" comments
  Magic => support doesn't work at end of buffer

Desired features:
  Copy indentation from first statement in body
  Delete-backward-expanding-tabs
  More consistency in font-lock highlighting
  Better support for \"/*\" comments

History:
  version 0.1: Quick one day hack -- appears to be useful
  version 0.2: Added font lock support
  version 0.3: Added misc features to work towards \"industrial strength\"
    Detects \"continuation lines\" and indents them specially
    Basic comment support
    Added \"symbol character\" support (with second syntax table for
    indentation and font-lock)
    Added indentation support for \"elseif\" and \"exception\" clauses
    Cleaned up a number of old bugs
  version 0.4: Brought into compliance with new \"post-DN22\" syntax
    new comment syntax
    new \"return types\" syntax
    accepts sealed, open, concrete, and abstract in class definitions
    fixed bug in comment indentation
    fine tune font-lock-regexps for \"define ...\"
  version 0.5:
    Added \"dylan-insert-block-end\" function.
    Fixed bug in short circuiting indentation outside top level forms.
  version 1.0:
    Major code reorganization
    Added full case statement support
    Fixed \"continuations\" at top level
    Added \"beginning-of-form\" and \"end-of-form\" commands
    Fixed support for character literals and for \"quoted\" quote chars
  version 1.1:
    The \"font-lock-mode\" support no longer interferes with other language
    modes.   (Thanks to emg@hip.atr.co.jp)
  version 1.2:
    Fixes for various bugs (thanks to wlott@cs.cmu.edu):
      \"foo-end;\" was mistaken for the end of a compound statement
      syntax tables sometimes ended in an odd state after errors
      indentation sometimes failed if parens weren't balanced
  version 1.3:
    Added font lock support for \"sealed\", \"open\", etc.
  version 1.4:
    Added special-case support for generic function \"continuations\" and
    for outdenting \"=>\" in function definitions.
  version 1.5:
    Adjusted regexps to accept \"primary\" and \"free\" adjectives
    Mentioned dylan-outdent-arrows in the documentation
    Added a space to comment-start
  version 1.6:
    Fixed bug in generic function continuations from 1.4.
  version 1.7:
    Merged changes from Joseph Wilson (jnw@cis.ufl.edu) to facilitate use 
    within more general modes.
  version 1.8:
    Font lock fix for XEmacs from John Shen <jshen@cas.org>.
  version 1.9:
    Fixed bug in indentation for expressions in square and curly braces.
    Generalized modifier-word handling for definitions.
    Generalized 'define words' lists for easier extension.
    Fixed \"exceeded max nesting\" bug with long lists of items.
    Added switches for font-lock highlighting of functions and definition 
    sites.
  version 1.10:
    Fixed bug in \",\" reindent code.  It couldn't deal with commas
    in the middle of strings.
  version 1.11 12/13/95 by David N. Gray <gray@harlequin.com>:
    Add C-M-a and C-M-e for beginning and end of definition.
    Fix font lock syntax table for XEmacs.
  version 1.12:
    Added support for \"define function\"
    Fixed to ignore keywords in the file header.
    Do not require \";\" after return value (contributed by
    gray@harlequin.com)
    fixed various bugs resulting from overzealous acceptance of newlines:
      the word \"end\" at the end of a comment line caused bad indentation
      empty module and library definitions did strange things.
  version 1.13:
    Fixed dylan-insert-block-end to handle \"define function\" properly.
    (Hopefully) fixed bug in indenting function result declarations,
    which was introduced by the previous round of fixes.
  version 1.14:
    Modified to use font-lock-syntax-table if it is defined.  This
    eliminates the need to use unportable constructs to modify the
    behavior of font-lock mode -- thus, fontification should now be
    reliable on modern EMACSen.
  version 1.15
    Fixed syntax table bugs which primarily affected gnu-emacs
    19.[23] users.  
    Optimized \"beyond-dylan-header\".  
    Removed new-lines from various font-lock regexps so that
    adjacent declarations aren't glommed together.
  version 1.16
    Made symbols properly fontify as strings.
    Added the dylan-no-highlights-in-header variable (enabled by
    default) which keeps keywords in headers from being treated
    specially.
  adjusted 12/6/96 by David N. Gray to set dylan-no-highlights-in-header
    only for Emacs 19.31 or later
  Modified 7/19/98 by David N. Gray to indent bodies of \"with-...\" macros.
  Modified 16 Jan 99 by Eric M. Kidd for C-FFI macros.
  version 1.17
    Various fixes and changes over quite some time by Chris Page.
    Retroactively bumped the version number after noticing that it
    had been left at 1.16 far too long.
  version 1.18
    Changed some user-modifiable variables to Customization
    variables and defined a Dylan customization group. Other
    miscellaneous fixes and changes.
  version 1.19
    Added fontification of the Dylan interchange file header.
    Other miscellaneous fixes and cleanups.
  version 1.20
    Added support for multiple levels of font-lock decoration.
  version 1.21
    Removed dylan-outdent-arrows. It should always be on.")

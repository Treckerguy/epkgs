This file is an unofficial add-on to Michael Kifer's Viper-mode.
It provides vi-like keymaps for various major modes, including
emacs-lisp-mode, lisp-mode, lisp-interaction-mode, slime-repl-mode,
LaTeX-mode, haskell-mode, prolog-mode and ruby-mode. If you have
any questions or comments, please e-mail the authors and
maintainer. We provide no guarantee of help with such early code.
If you extend this file to cover additional modes, we would be very
grateful; please contact us.

There are no installation instructions or usage instructions, but
we might be able to help you out if you contact us. If you wrote
such instructions and added them to EmacsWiki, we would appreciate
it!

This is alpha-quality code. If it works for you, please let us
know.")

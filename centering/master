 :commentary "\
This mode ensures that the cursor is always in the center of the
display. This can be useful at times if, for example, you are
trying to get lots of stuff onto one screen for a screenshot, or to
read without using the keyboard. 

It has one major entry point which is `centering-mode' which turns
on a minor mode. 

It currently works by recentering the display after the line
position has changed. There is a delay before this happens or the
constant redisplaying makes the emacs look horrible. Set
`centering-timer-delay' to change the length of the delay. Setting
it to 0 is permissible. 


Todo

Well it doesn't work. So fix the centering-recenter function. Also 
this should only use a single timer. When switching on, check for
timer, start if not. When switching off check whether there are any
centering buffers left open, if not kill it. 

The current logic is imperfect, because if the a key is
autorepeated, then the system will not update when the up key is
removed. Perhaps I should move back to the old delay system.")

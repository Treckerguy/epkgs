When browsing files in dired buffer, it would be convenient to be
able to jump to a file by typing that filename's first
character. This is what this extension does.

Put this file into your load-path and the following into your
~/.emacs:
      (require 'dired-view)

To enable it by default,

      (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'dired-view-minor-mode-on)

Also, you could define keys to toggle it,

      (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd \";\") 'dired-view-minor-mode-toggle)
      (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd \":\") 'dired-view-minor-mode-dired-toggle)")

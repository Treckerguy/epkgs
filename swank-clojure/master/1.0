 :commentary "\
The purpose of this file is to set up `slime-lisp-implementations'
to allow SLIME to communicate with the Swank server implemented in
Clojure. There are three ways to launch SLIME:

1. Standalone M-x slime: swank-clojure will download the jars for
   Clojure 1.0, contrib, and swank-clojure and connect to it. Good
   for beginners wanting to try things out!

2. Custom classpath: If you have your own newer copies of Clojure
   and other jars you'd like to use, set swank-clojure-classpath to
   point to them, then hit M-x slime.

3. Project: Put your project's dependencies in the lib/ directory,
   then launch M-x swank-clojure-project.")

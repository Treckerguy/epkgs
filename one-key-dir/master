Functions for quickly navigating directory trees with one-key menus

`one-key-dir-visit' can be used to navigate a directory tree and apply functions 
 to files. It's not an interactive function, so you should write wrapping functions
 yourself. You can refer to `one-key-dir/find-file' as an example, which can be
 used to navigate to and open a file using one-key.

NOTE: hidden files and directories are excluded from the one-key menus generated, 
as are backup files (files whose names begin with \"~\"). This is to keep the number of
items in the one-key menus small enough so that enough keys can be generated.
Also note that if the number of items is large they may not all fit in the viewing area
of the one-key menu. In this case you can use the UP/DOWN arrow keys to scroll the menu 
up and down to view the rest of the items.

Installation:

Put one-key-dir.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name \"~/elisp\"))
where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
(you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).

Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.

(require 'one-key-dir)")

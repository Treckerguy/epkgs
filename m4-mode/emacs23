 :commentary "\
A smart editing mode for m4 macro definitions.  It seems to have most of the
syntax right (sexp motion commands work, but function motion commands don't).
It also sets the font-lock syntax stuff for colorization

To Do's:

* want to make m4-m4-(buffer|region) look sorta like M-x compile look&feel ?
* sexp motion commands don't seem to work right")

Here's a couple of commands I find indispensible;; they might as well
see the light of day now, while I'm thinking of them.  I bind them
thus:

(global-set-key \"\\M-p\" 'duplicate-previous-line)
(global-set-key \"\\M-n\" 'duplicate-following-line)

and they behave in ordinary text buffers something like the same keys
do in buffers with history, duplicating lines from nearby in the
buffer.

I included my `point-at' macro rather than expanding it out by hand.

Copyright notice included even though I doubt it's needed on something
so small.")

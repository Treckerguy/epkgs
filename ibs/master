 :commentary "\
This Emacs package provides a minor mode for buffer cycling;
more exact: to switch by key C-TAB between Emacs buffers like
MS-Windows IDEs.
C-TAB starts buffer cycling.  Every other key terminates cycling
and sets the current buffer at the top of Emacs buffer list.
The buffer we started buffer cycling won't be buried !!!

You can configure the keys for cycling.
Therefore set global `ibs-cycling-key' before loading ibs.el.

You can define which buffers will be used for buffer cycling.
Set global `ibs-cycle-buffer-function' to a function which
returns a buffer list. The default is buffer-list, which returns
all buffers in recently order.
If package bs is loaded the cycling list of this package
will be used.")

 :commentary "\
This package provides an interface from JDE (see http://jde.sunsite.dk/) to
Lint4j (see http://www.jutils.com/). Lint4j (\"Lint for Java\") is a static
Java source code analyzer that detects locking and threading issues,
performance and scalability problems, and checks complex contracts such as
Java serialization by performing type, data flow, and lock graph analysis.

Installation:

 1) Download and install the Lint4J tool from http://www.jutils.com/download.html

 2) Put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path and add the following into
 your .emacs startup file

     (require 'jde-lint)

 3) Customize the variable `jde-lint-option-path' to point to the Lint4j
 installation directory.

 4) Make sure JDE is properly configured. In particular set the variables
 jde-jdk-registry and jde-jdk so that the JVM launcher can be found.")

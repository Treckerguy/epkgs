This is a slight hack to display disk usage in the mode line.
 Disk space remaining is updated every df-refresh second.

 If you work with a lot of users sharing the same partition, it
 sometimes happens that you have no place left to save your work,
 which drives you to serious brain damage when you lost important
 work.  This package allows you to have place left and buffer size
 displayed in the mode line, so you know when you can save your
 file or when it's time to do some cleanup.

 This package may (must) not be very optimized or efficient, but
 this is a quick hack.  Comments and suggestions are welcome.

 df is simple to use :
 - Put this file in your load-path
 - Put the following in your .emacs : (autoload 'df \"df\" nil t)
 - Add something like (df \"/home\") in your .emacs if you want to
   scan /home

Revision 1.8  2001/12/07 13:08:16  benj
- fixed a misplaced (interactive)

Revision 1.7  2000/06/05 11:19:22  benj
 - put some variables local so buffer size is buffer-local
 - add a hook to find-file-hook to display correct size

Revision 1.6  1999/11/05 22:04:03  benj
- Now use a minor mode instead of that ugly dance with mode-line-format
- Really use variables instead of constants in the code
- Better structuration (df-enable and df-disable)
- Some more documentation
- Licence typos fixed

Revision 1.5  1999/01/24 17:25:54  drieu
- Add Paal Steihaug remarks :
  + use magic df argument, which only scan a partition
  + add (require 'cl)
  + df-update is now much clean
  + df now use either 'df -m' or 'df -k' when it is needed

Revision 1.4  1999/01/04 14:51:01  drieu
- Correct a bug so Megabytes are *REALLY* Megabytes

Revision 1.3  1999/01/02 15:46:44  drieu
- Fix few bugs one more time
- Add variables instead of hard-coded strings
- Add argument for df
- Document the file a bit more

Revision 1.2  1998/12/15 17:37:42  drieu
- Fix few bugs
- Add Buffer size in the mode line
- Mesure either in K or Mega bytes
- And so on...


Things to do :

- add 'customize' support
- sleep a little bit")

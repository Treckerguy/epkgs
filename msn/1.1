 :commentary "\
If, like me, you use LaTeX/BibTeX to manage the references in your
technical writings, you will find the database at MathSciNet
(http://www.ams.org/mathscinet) useful. It provides a standardized
format for references which can be put directly in a .bib file.

This library provides an interface to this facility. On invocation,
it queries the user for an author and title and fetches the BibteX
entries using the form at http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search. The
result will be a

(a) W3 buffer with the search results, or
(b) bibtex-mode buffer with the search results parsed out

depending on the variable msn-use-w3. The default is to use W3.

Note: Access to the database is restricted and subscribtion is
required.")

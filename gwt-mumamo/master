 :commentary "\
The Google Web Toolkit (GWT) allows you to write client-side code for
web applications in Java, which is translated to JavaScript by the GWT
compiler. It is possible to write inline JavaScript via the JavaScript
Native Interface (JSNI), and this mode uses MuMaMo from nXhtml to
provide support for both Java and inline JavaScript in the same file.

Installation:

In order to use gwt-mumamo, you will need nXhtml, get it here:
  http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/nxhtml.html

If your Emacs version is 23.1 or below, you will need espresso-mode:
  http://www.nongnu.org/espresso/
You also need to add an alias to it, add the following to your init
file:
  (defalias 'js-mode 'espresso-mode)

Add this file to your load-path and add the following line to your
init file:
  (autoload 'gwt-mumamo-mode \"gwt-mumamo\" \"\" t)
You can now activate gwt-mumamo by invoking \"gwt-mumamo-mode\"

gwt-mumamo works just like java-mode when used for normal Java
files, so you can use it as the standard mode for all .java files
if you like:
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\.java$\" . gwt-mumamo-mode))

The only notable difference between java-mode and gwt-mumamo-mode
is the background colour, because mumamo changes it. If you want
the same background colour as in other modes, add:
  (setq mumamo-chunk-coloring 1)
This will make mumamo colour only inline code.")

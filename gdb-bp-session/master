 :commentary "\
gdb-bp-session provides keeping breakpoints which you set recently
in gdb.  You should kill gdb buffer using `gdb-kill-buffer'
function \"C-x k\" to save current breakpoints, that's all. Is it too
easy? The current breakpionts are saved to
`$HOME/.$PROCESS_NAME-breakpoints.gdb'

* Installation
  Edit your ~/.emacs file to add the line:
    (add-to-list 'load-path \"/path/to/gdb-bp-session\")
    (require 'gdb-bp-session)")

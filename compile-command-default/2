This spot of code lets you establish a default `compile-command' for
M-x compile etc.

Each function in `compile-command-default-functions' can contemplate the
buffer filename, directory, contents, etc, and decide a compile-command
they would apply.  The included functions run perl development or test
programs, either directly or through the test harness.

The operative part is really just the hack to `hack-local-variables' to
get a good point to establish a default.  The list of functions is mainly
so they can do weird and wonderful tests for when they apply, and can
then build something perhaps with absolute directorys etc.

See mode-compile.el for a bigger system geared more towards language
compiles like gcc etc.")

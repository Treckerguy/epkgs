This is the beginnings of a library for interfacing with
twitter.com from Emacs.  It is also (more importantly) some
interactive functions that use that library.  It's a hack, of
course; RMS i am not.  Maybe one of you real programmers would
like to clean it up?

Okay! ;)

Twit.el is rapidly maturing library.  Currently it handles your
friends timeline, direct messagse (sending and receiving) and
even searches.

You can use the function `twit-post' to send a tweet.  Heck
I'd appreciate knowing who uses twit.el so go ahead and tweet
something to that effect!

You can use the function `twit-follow-recent-tweets' to have
twit.el constantly check updates, and write them in a buffer.
alternatly, you can just use `twit-show-recent-tweets'
to just show you the last 15 tweets.  In this timeline view
type ? to show you a list of commands you can use.

For searches, you an use `twit-search' to run a general search.
The search will remember the terms you used, so you can use
tab completion when promped.  Also, you can customize the
variable `twit-completing-searches' to store your common
searches for later.  The command `twit-search-at-to-me' to do
a @<username> search.  The search functions were just recently
added, and their output will be improved soon.

For direct messages you can use `twit-show-direct-tweets' to
get your direct messages, and `twit-direct' to send them.

If you want, you can display images on the timeline as well,
customize the variable `twit-show-user-images', and set it to
true.  When you do that, you'll also get tab completion on
the twit direct function.

Both `twit-show-direct-tweets' and `twit-show-recent-tweets'
can accept numeric prefix commands.  With a numeric prefix,
they will skip to that page.  So:
     C-u 2 M-x twit-show-recent-tweets
will take you to the next page of recent tweets (older ones)

This uses Twitter's XML-based api, not the JSON one because i
would like to avoid making the user install third-party libraries
to use it.

Even though twit.el uses Basic Authentication, it also uses HTTPS
to connect to twitter (for all auth based services anyway).  So
security problems are dealt with.")

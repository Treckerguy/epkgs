This is an Emacs mode to fetch lyrics from LyricWiki.com.
Just press M-x lyrics, enter your artist and the song and you
should get your lyrics right away.

Installation:

Download lyricwiki.el to some directory:
$ git clone git://github.com/febuiles/lyricwiki.el.git

Add it to your load list and require it:

(add-to-list 'load-path \"~/some_directory/lyricwiki.el\")
(require 'lyricwiki)

Now just press:

  M-x lyrics

And get your lyrics.

If you want to automatically fetch the lyrics for the current song in
iTunes (OS X), Amarok or Rhythmbox (Linux) you can use:

  M-x lyrics-itunes
  M-x lyrics-amarok
  M-x lyrics-rhythmbox

Finally, if you always want me to automatically fetch the current playing
artist/song then just set me up in the defalias down there!")

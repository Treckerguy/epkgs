 :commentary "\
Have you ever spent time searching for a .el file you know you have
somewhere?  Or have you ever tried to remember exactly what a file
was called.  Then this might be what you want, it is basically a
wrapper around (find-file (locate-library \"foo.el\")), but with
filename completion.

This provides one user function `find-lib-locate-library', which
you can bind to a key if you want.")

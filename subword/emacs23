This package was cc-submode.el before it was recognized being
useful in general and not tied to C and c-mode at all.

This package provides `subword' oriented commands and a minor mode
(`subword-mode') that substitutes the common word handling
functions with them.

In spite of GNU Coding Standards, it is popular to name a symbol by
mixing uppercase and lowercase letters, e.g. \"GtkWidget\",
\"EmacsFrameClass\", \"NSGraphicsContext\", etc.  Here we call these
mixed case symbols `nomenclatures'.  Also, each capitalized (or
completely uppercase) part of a nomenclature is called a `subword'.
Here are some examples:

 Nomenclature           Subwords
 ===========================================================
 GtkWindow          =>  \"Gtk\" and \"Window\"
 EmacsFrameClass    =>  \"Emacs\", \"Frame\" and \"Class\"
 NSGraphicsContext  =>  \"NS\", \"Graphics\" and \"Context\"

The subword oriented commands defined in this package recognize
subwords in a nomenclature to move between them and to edit them as
words.

In the minor mode, all common key bindings for word oriented
commands are overridden by the subword oriented commands:

Key     Word oriented command      Subword oriented command
============================================================
M-f     `forward-word'             `subword-forward'
M-b     `backward-word'            `subword-backward'
M-@     `mark-word'                `subword-mark'
M-d     `kill-word'                `subword-kill'
M-DEL   `backward-kill-word'       `subword-backward-kill'
M-t     `transpose-words'          `subword-transpose'
M-c     `capitalize-word'          `subword-capitalize'
M-u     `upcase-word'              `subword-upcase'
M-l     `downcase-word'            `subword-downcase'

Note: If you have changed the key bindings for the word oriented
commands in your .emacs or a similar place, the keys you've changed
to are also used for the corresponding subword oriented commands.

To make the mode turn on automatically, put the following code in
your .emacs:

(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
	  (lambda () (subword-mode 1)))


Acknowledgment:
The regular expressions to detect subwords are mostly based on
the old `c-forward-into-nomenclature' originally contributed by
Terry_Glanfield dot Southern at rxuk dot xerox dot com.

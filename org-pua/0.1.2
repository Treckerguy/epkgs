This is a file annotation system using an org-mode file to store the
annotations separate to the original file.  The annotations can be displayed
either by jumping to the annotations file or by showing the annotated
locations in the file as button-links to the annotations which can either be
displayed in a tooltip or in the echo area.

This package borrows ideas and code from:

    `org-annotate-file.el' package by Philip Jackson (now supplied with
    `org-mode' in the `contrib' directory) from which the idea of using
    `org-mode' to store the annotations originates,

    http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ipa.el by Tamas Patrovics from which the
    idea of displaying the annotations \"in-place\" originates,

    http://www.mail-archive.com/gnu-emacs-sources@gnu.org/msg01726/rw-acronyms.el
    by Ralf Wachinger from which the idea of using `widget' buttons to enable
    the annotation to be displayed \"in-place\" on request


    http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/tooltip-help.el by Tamas Patrovics which
    provides the mechanism to display the annotation tooltip at the `point'
    without the need to resort to mouse wrestling.

To use put the following in your .emacs:
    (require 'org-pua)

And for convenience bind the important functions to key of your choice, e.g.
    (global-set-key [(control c) f1] 'org-pua-annotate)
    (global-set-key [(control c) (control f1)] 'org-pua-toggle-buttons)

To change the location of the annotation file:
    (setq org-pua-annotations-file \"~/annotated.org\")

To view an existing annotation or add a new one corresponding to the current
file and location hit C-c C-l which will read the corresponding annotations
org file, automatically adding a link-headline for the annotation or if one
already exist positioning the `point' on the link-headline and narrowing the
buffer to show only that entry.

To automatically insert a subheading corresponding to the current line set
`org-pua-add-line-entry' to `t'.

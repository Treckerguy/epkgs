 :commentary "\
Frame-bufs extends Emacs's buffer menu so that it understands a
distinction between those buffers that associated with a frame and those
that do not.  The buffer menu can be toggled between listing all buffers
and listing only those buffers associated with the frame (we say that such
buffers are \"local\" to the frame).  Buffers can be added to and removed
from the frame's local buffer list.  The criteria for which buffers belong
to a frame can be customized.

Installation
============

Put this file in your load path and put:

  (require 'frame-bufs)

in your .emacs.  To toggle frame-bufs mode on and off, use the command
`frame-bufs-mode'.  To turn it on automatically when starting Emacs, put:

 (frame-bufs-mode t) 

in your .emacs.  

Usage
=====

Frame-bufs operates fairly transparently.  By default a new buffer-menu
initially lists all buffers.  By typing `F' one can toggle between listing
all buffers (\"full-list mode\") and listing only those buffers associated
with the selected frame (\"local-list mode\").")

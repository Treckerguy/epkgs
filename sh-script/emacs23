 :commentary "\
Major mode for editing shell scripts.  Bourne, C and rc shells as well
as various derivatives are supported and easily derived from.  Structured
statements can be inserted with one command or abbrev.  Completion is
available for filenames, variables known from the script, the shell and
the environment as well as commands.")

Extensions to `diff.el' for Emacs 21.
   The frame is resized to fit buffer \"*Diff*\".

 Library `diff.el' changed significantly from Emacs 20 to Emacs 21.
 For extensions to `diff.el' that work with Emacs versions prior to
 version 21, see library `diff+20.el'.

 For extensions to `diff' highlighting in Emacs 21, see library
 `diff-mode-.el'.


 ***** NOTE: The following function defined in `diff.el' has
             been REDEFINED HERE:

   `diff-sentinel' - Fits frame to *Diff* buffer.


 This file should be loaded *after* loading the standard GNU file
 `diff.el'.  So, in your `~/.emacs' file, do this:

   (eval-after-load \"diff\" '(require 'diff+))")

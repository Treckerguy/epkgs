  This file implements many of the features of VC for use with
  StarTeam (www.starbase.com), a source control program.


  ^X-v-v    - Do next action:
	Current ->     Display the message \"Up to Date\"
	Out of Date -> Do a check out
	Merge ->       Run emerge
	Modified ->    Checkin with a comment
  ^X-v-l    - Get a history of the file
  ^X-v-=    - Do an ediff on the contents of the current buffer with
              the latest version in source control
  ^X-v-d    - Get a status of all files in the current directory
  ^X-v-^I   - Get a list of files to check in in for a directory and all sub directories
  ^X-v-^O   - Get a list of files to check out in for a directory and all sub directories
  ^X-v-^L   - Lock the file
  ^X-v-^U   - Unlock the file

Configuration:

At a minimum you need to set the following:

  (setq starteam-host \"10.42.42.2\"   ; or \"myMachine.myCompany.com\"
        starteam-executable \"stcmd\"
        starteam-to-directory-alist (list (cons  \"^/export/home/username/working\"  \"src/src\" )))

You will need to customize starteam-to-directory-alist to your
particular Starteam projects; see the doc comments for more
details on the structure of this variable.

In addition, there are also several other variables that configure
the behavior of starteam.el:

   starteam-dired-mode-name
   starteam-port
   starteam-user
   starteam-password
   starteam-keep-unlocked-files-read-only
   starteam-unlock-after-checkin
   starteam-switch-to-output
   starteam-debug
   starteam-post-checkin-functions

Users may also wish to call 
 
   starteam-menubar-setup 

to add a STARTEAM menu to the main menu bar.")

 :commentary "\
The purpose of this package is to allow to run Emacs functions
with the sole help of the mouse. For instance, when indexing a
book, it is easier to index words by simply clicking (or dragging)
on them rather than moving the dot towards them then running
\\C-x\\C-e (as one of possible choice).  With MousyMacro, you just
define what clicks mean and then it is up to you to click
wherever you want.  Usually the left button means \"run the
currently associated macro\", the middle button means \"stop
MousyMacro\" and the right one allows to choose with a menu the
macro to be associated to the left button as well as other actions
such as Undo! The Left and Middle buttons can be programmed.

Installation and Demonstration:

To use this package, add to your .emacs (taking care of load-path)
           (require 'mousymacro)
MousyMacro is under your fingers with
     \\M-x mousy-macro
Click on the right button to see the defaults, then choose the \"funny\"
item, then click where you want in the buffer and observe the Minibuffer.
Click on the middle button to stop MousyMacro.")

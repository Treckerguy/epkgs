xgtags.el provides an interface to the GLOBAL
(http://www.gnu.org/software/global) cross-refencing tools. While
gtags.el, that comes with the GLOBAL distribution, is more a
replacement for emacs' own find-tag/pop-tag-mark facility with some
extra stuff, xtags.el tries to permit the same functionality as
gtags.el, but behaves more like xcscope.el, the emacs interface for
cscope (http://cscope.sourceforge.net).

xgtags consists of xgtags-mode, a minor that should work with any
major mode, especially the programming modes, and
xgtags-select-mode which presents the result of the last query to
the user.


Installation

To use xgtags copy this file to some place where emacs can find it,
if necessary add the path you chose to the load-path variable. In
your .emacs add the line

	(require 'xgtags)

In any buffer you can now toggle xgtags-mode by calling the
interactive command with same name. Since this is a bit annoying,
you might choose to turn it on for some specific modes. For c-mode
you can add something like the following snippet to your .emacs
file. Other modes provide similar hooks.

        (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
                  (lambda ()
		        (xgtags-mode 1)))

After that you can use the predefined keybindings to query your
GLOBAL database. Call 'describe-function RET xgtags-mode' to get an
overview of those bindings.")

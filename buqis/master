Main feature of buqis is fast navigation and abbility to attach
some info, used by buqis to filter buffers to selected frame. Say
in frame1 you work with emacs lisp files, in frame2 you work under
project written in C and frame3 you use to browse Web with w3m. So
in frame1 you want swithing only to .el buffers, in frame2 to .c,
.h or info and frame3 only for w3m buffers. You may do it executing
`buqis-put-frame-ctx' command.

You may start by adding next to your .emacs:

	(require 'buqis)
	(buqis-install-keybinds)
	(buqis-add-default-ctxs)

To change buqis context to selected frame use:

	M-x buqis-put-frame-ctx <RET>

If you want buqis context in title then set `frame-title-format' to
something like this:

	(setq frame-title-format
	      '(\"Emacs: %b\"
		(buqis-current-context \" -\")
		(buqis-current-context buqis-current-context)
		(buqis-current-context \"-\")
		\" %*%& %f\"))")

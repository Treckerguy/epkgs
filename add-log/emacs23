This facility is documented in the Emacs Manual.

Todo:

- Find/use/create _MTN/log if there's a _MTN directory.
- Find/use/create ++log.* if there's an {arch} directory.
- Use an open *VC-Log* or *cvs-commit* buffer if it's related to the
  source file.
- Don't add TAB indents (and username?) if inserting entries in those
  special places.")

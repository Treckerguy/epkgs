 :commentary "\
This is a minor mode for writers and editors which tweaks the
behavior of some Emacs commands to make them more efficient at
editing English text, and defines some new commands which may be
found useful.

I am aware that this code defines more abstractions than it
actually uses.  But there are bound to be special cases I haven't
anticipated where they may come in handy.")

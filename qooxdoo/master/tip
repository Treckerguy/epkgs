You'll need espect, see <https://github.com/rafl/espect>.

After that, something like:

(require 'espect)
(require 'qooxdoo)

(setq qooxdoo-workspace-path \"~/workspace\")
(setq qooxdoo-project-paths
      '(\"/path/to/project/1\"
        \"Foo/bar/baz/project2\"))
(setq espect-buffer-settings
      '(((:qooxdoo)
         (lambda ()
           (qooxdoo-minor-mode t)))))

in your .emacs should do just fine.

`qooxdoo-workspace-path' should be the path to your root \"coding\" folder,
assuming you keep one. It's just a slight typing saver.

`qooxdoo-project-paths' should be a list of paths to directories containing
qooxdoo projects. If you're not using `qooxdoo-workspace-path', these should
be absolute. If you are using `qooxdoo-workspace-path', these are interpreted
as relative to that.")

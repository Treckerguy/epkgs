 :commentary "\
This is a bare-bones hyperlink system.  It does not aspire to be
XLL. Its humble virtue is that it is here now and works with psgml
in arbitrary SGML and XML documents.  You don't need to have XLL or
anything of the sort.

What it does is allow you to specify attributes of elements in your
various doctypes that will act like local hyperlinks.  IE, when the
point is in the proper element, M-x tehom-psgml-follow-link will
bring up the file that the element links to.  

You set this up by setting the value of tehom-psgml-link-list.  The
easiest way to do this is to customize tehom-psgml-link-list, where
it should be self-explanatory.

NB, this handles links to local files only.  If someone wants to
extend this to work with ftap or browse-url or something similar,
be my guest.


To install, 
  Put tehom-psgml-link somewhere on your load path
  Set up an autoload for tehom-psgml-follow-link
  Customize tehom-psgml-link-list

You'll want to re-customize tehom-psgml-link-list every time you
want another dtd to act like it has hyperlinks.")

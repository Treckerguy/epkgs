This toy lets you render a region of ascii text upside-down.  That is,
the characters in the region will be substituted with upside-down
equivalents (or the nearest approximation) from the unicode character set.
Running this function twice over a region should reverse the effect.

This might only work properly in utf8 buffers; I haven't tested other
coding systems.")

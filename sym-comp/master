 :commentary "\
This defines `symbol-complete', which is a generalization of the
old `lisp-complete-symbol'.  It provides the following hooks to
allow major modes to set up completion appropriate for the mode:
`symbol-completion-symbol-function',
`symbol-completion-completions-function',
`symbol-completion-predicate-function',
`symbol-completion-transform-function'.  Typically it is only
necessary for a mode to set
`symbol-completion-completions-function' locally and to bind
`symbol-complete' appropriately.

It's unfortunate that there doesn't seem to be a good way of
combining this with `complete-symbol'.

There is also `symbol-completion-try-complete', for use with
Hippie-exp.

As an example, `lisp-complete-symbol' is defined below using this
infrastructure to replace the old one from lisp.el with the same
functionality.")

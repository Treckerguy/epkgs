 :commentary "\
Loading menu-tree.el replaces the texts of menu-bar items
with the various languages' translations. By default, Japanese
translation data are applied.

This program, originally written by YAGI Tatsuya in 1999
(http://www.ysnb.net/meadow/meadow-users-jp/1999/msg01278.html),
has been rewritten completely by current maintainer, and now
can be used for GNU Emacs 22 and 23. (Emacs 21 or earlier is no
longer supported.)


Installation:

Save this file as menu-tree.el in a directory listed in
load-path, and put the following into your .emacs file:

  (require 'menu-tree)

If many unreadable characters appear in menu-bar, set
`menu-tree-coding-system' the appropriate coding system
before loading this program. For example,

  (if (and (= emacs-major-version 22)
           (eq window-system 'x))
      (setq menu-tree-coding-system 'utf-8))
  (require 'menu-tree)")

 :commentary "\
These functions are meant to be primitives with which to build other
header-parsing and manipulating routines.

These functions use mail-header-separator to determine the end of the
mail header list in a given buffer.  This string is by default set to
\"--text follows this line--\" but you can change it to something else
temporarily via a (let ...).  To hack incoming email messages in their
presentation buffer, for example, you would bind that variable to \"\".

I find it particular useful to put this in my .emacs:
   (require 'fmailutils)
   (add-hook 'mail-send-hook 'fmailutils-add-fcc-related-headers)
So that my saved messages get threaded properly with VM and GNUS.

Inspiration for this package came from a couple of mail-parsing
functions written by Mike Williams around 1991 or so.

New versions of this program should usually be available from

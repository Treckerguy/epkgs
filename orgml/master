 :commentary "\
OrgML is a package to export Org Mode files to XML.  The XML file
produced from an Org Mode file contains all the information in the
original file without any of the quirky (but wonderful!) Org Mode
syntax.  A section of an Org Mode file which looks like

  * Top Level Heading
  This is some text.
  ** Subheading                    :tag1:tag2
  This is some /italic/ text
  ** TODO A todo item
     DEADLINE: <2009-01-11 Sun 18:00>

Would be transformed to (ignoring the preceding XML boilerplate)

  <heading level=\"1\">
    <title>Top Level Heading</title>
    <paragraph>This is some text.</paragraph>
    <heading level=\"2\">
      <title>Subheading</title>
      <tags>
        <tag>tag1</tag>
        <tag>tag2</tag>
      </tags>
      <paragraph>This is some <italics>italic</italics> text.</paragraph>
      <headline level=\"3\" todo=\"TODO\">
        <title>A todo item</title>
        <deadline>2009-01-11 Sun 18:00</deadline>
      </heading>
    </heading>
  </heading>

The information is all there waiting to be read by some tool which
understands XML.")

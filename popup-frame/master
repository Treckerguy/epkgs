This file aimed to provide some utility functions for the
management of popup frames. A popup frame is a 'X Window' with no
decoration (no titlebar, not in the taskbar) that can be considered
as a subwindow for Emacs. It can be useful for example to create a
temporary completion UI.

Currently it works only in a the 'x `window-system'. Contributions
are welcome mainly for the 'ns and 'w32 window systems.

Usage example:

(let ((the-frame (popup-frame-create)))
  (popup-frame-show the-frame)
  (set-frame-position the-frame 200 200)
  (set-frame-size the-frame 80 24)
  (popup-frame-hide the-frame)
  (popup-frame-destroy the-frame))")

 :commentary "\
Simple package to convert the block cursor into a bar cursor.  In
 overwrite mode, the bar cursor changes back into a block cursor.
 This is a quasi-minor mode, meaning that it can be turned on & off
 easily though only globally (hence the quasi-)

Installation:

 Put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path and add the following to
 your ~/.emacs startup file

    (require 'bar-cursor)
    (bar-cursor-mode 1)

 To add a directory to your load-path, use something like the following:

     (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name \"/some/load/path\"))")

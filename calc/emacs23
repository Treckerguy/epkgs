 :commentary "\
Calc is split into many files.  This file is the main entry point.
This file includes autoload commands for various other basic Calc
facilities.  The more advanced features are based in calc-ext, which
in turn contains autoloads for the rest of the Calc files.  This
odd set of interactions is designed to make Calc's loading time
be as short as possible when only simple calculations are needed.

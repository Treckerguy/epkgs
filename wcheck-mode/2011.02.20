General interface for text checkers

Wcheck is a minor mode for automatically checking and marking strings
in Emacs buffer. Wcheck sends (parts of) buffer's content to a
text-checker back-end and, based on its output, decides if some parts
of text should be marked.

Wcheck can be used with external spell-checker programs such as
Ispell, Aspell and Enchant, but actually any tool that can receive
text stream from standard input and send text to standard output can
be used. The checker back-end can also be an Emacs Lisp function.")

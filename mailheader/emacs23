 :commentary "\
This package provides an abstraction to RFC822-style messages, used in
mail, news, and some other systems.  The simple syntactic rules for such
headers, such as quoting and line folding, are routinely reimplemented
in many individual packages.  This package removes the need for this
redundancy by representing message headers as association lists,
offering functions to extract the set of headers from a message, to
parse individual headers, to merge sets of headers, and to format a set
of headers.

The car of each element in the message-header alist is a symbol whose
print name is the name of the header, in all lower-case.  The cdr of an
element depends on the operation.  After extracting headers from a
message, it is a string, the value of the header.  An extracted set of
headers may be parsed further, which may turn it into a list, whose car
is the original value and whose subsequent elements depend on the
header.  For formatting, it is evaluated to obtain the strings to be
inserted.  For merging, one set of headers consists of strings, while
the other set will be evaluated with the symbols in the first set of
headers bound to their respective values.")

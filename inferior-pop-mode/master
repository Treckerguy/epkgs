Inferior pop mode - run poplog processes under GNU Emacs/XEmacs.        
                                                                 
        Hacked from prolog-mode bsl 17.07.89                     
        Variously mutilated by RJC.                              
                                                                 
In its current form this is rather fragile and prone to timing problems.
In an attempt to reduce these, we have switched back from using the
inferior pop buffer directly for compilation (using comint-send-string)
to using temporary files.  This increases the dependence on a (slow) 
fileserver (which the previous version was designed to avoid), but seems
to be marginally more robust.  Life would be a lot easier if ISL could be
persuaded to change the Pop continuation prompt.

The changelog is at the end of this file.")

Call the viewers of Unix manual pages and GNU Info with completion.

This package provides the `iman' command.
The `iman' command reads the name of a Unix manual page or an item of
GNU Info top directory in the minibuffer with completion, and shows
that page.

The job of actually showing the page is done by calling the standard
viewers.


Requirements:

Tested with FSF Emacs 20.6.2 and XEmacs 21.1.9 on Debian GNU/Linux.

You need a man(1) program. You probably have one already if you
run a Unix like system.


Enhancements:

completing-help.el (>= version 3.3)

  by pressing <TAB> (XEmacs only) or `?' which looks like:

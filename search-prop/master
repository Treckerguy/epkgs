 :commentary "\
The routines in this file are used to quickly search through text
properties in the current buffer.  It is even possible to look for
a property with a particular value.

The first application of these methods was for finding the next (or
previous) instance of a URL.  This is accomplished by searching for
text that has already been fontified, in order to identify that of
the fontified face of that URL.

`search-property' does most of the work.  It is a generalized
search routine that takes the direction of the search, whether the
search is permitted to cycle to the other end of the buffer, the
property to search for, and (optionally) the particular value that
the property should have.

The search will wrap around to the other end of the buffer when the
CYCLE argument is passed to `search-property'.

This library also provides the functions `search-property-forward'
and `search-property-backward', which should be reminiscent of the
Emacs functions `search-forward' and `search-backward'.

its authors wish to incorporate this code into Emacs proper at some

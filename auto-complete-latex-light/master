 :commentary "\
Last year, I wrote the auto-complete-latex for completing the
latex keywords. It had many useful functions, but in some situations,
it degraded PC's performance. So I rewrote a simple version of it.

This program provides the two sources for auto-complete-mode
under the modes for latex. Provided sources are below:

`ac-source-latex-commands-in-same-mode-buffers',
`ac-source-latex-dictionary'.

Note that this version is not compatible with auto-complete-latex.
If you want to use all functions, please try the original version
<https://bitbucket.org/tequilasunset/auto-complete-latex>.

Requirements:

auto-complete-mode - <http://github.com/m2ym/auto-complete>")

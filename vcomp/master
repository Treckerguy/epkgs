 :commentary "\
Compare version strings.  What is a valid version string is defined
jointly by the regular expression stored in variable `vcomp--regexp'
and the function `vcomp--intern'.

Even crazy version strings like \"0.11a_rc3-r1\" are supported.  But
note that you shouldn't go crazy just because you can and that the
\\\"-rN\\\" suffix while valid really is reserved for package maintainers
like ELPA or the Emacsmirror and should not be used by library authors.

Some related (or alternative) libraries and functions:

- `version<' and related functions defined in `subr.el' distributed
  with Emacs, or stand-alone as `versions.el'.
- `inversion' which is part of Cedet and therefor included in recent
  versions of Emacs.
- `package.el' also contains some version handling code which this
  package was originally based on.")

suffix should not be used by authors of libraries but rather is for
maintainers of packages (like ELPA or the Emacsmirror).

Some related (or alternative) libraries and functions:

- `version<' and related functions defined in `subr.el' distributed
  with Emacs, or stand-alone as `versions.el'.
- `inversion' which is part of Cedet and therefor included in recent
  versions of Emacs.

This package is in part based on code from `package.el' which is:

I maintain the hypertext parts of my website with John Wiegley's
emacs-wiki.el, now maintained by Damien Elmes at
http://repose.cx/emacs/wiki.  You will need to install a copy of that
file before this one is of any use to you.

* Startup

To begin using emacs-wiki-journal, put this in your .emacs file:

  (load \"emacs-wiki-journal\")

Now you can add an entry to your journal with
M-x emacs-wiki-journal-add-entry, give it a WikiName for a category
to index the entry under (usually beginning \"Category\") and a header
line for the new entry.  A suitable header for today's entry will
added to emacs-wiki-journal-wiki where you add the body for the entry
and a cross reference will be added to the category index.  If you have
a PNG icon in the emacs-wiki-category-icons-url then the icon named
after the CategoryWiki will be inserted in the journal header.

You may need to set up a stylesheet to layout the journal page as you
want it.  Look at mine as an example:

  http://www.oranda.demon.co.uk/journal.css

You should also type M-x customize-group, and give the name
\"emacs-wiki-journal\".  Change it to suit your preferences.  Each of
the options has its own documentation.

* Key Bindings

You might want to bind emacs-wiki-journal-add-entry to a key in your
global keymap:

  (define-key ctl-x-4-map
              \"j\" 'emacs-wiki-journal-add-entry-other-window)

And also in emacs-wiki mode:

  (add-hook 'emacs-wiki-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (local-set-key \"C-cj\" 'emacs-wiki-journal-add-entry)))")

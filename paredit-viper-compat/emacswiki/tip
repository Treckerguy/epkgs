This mode allows paredit to work when viper is enabled.

Usage:
Place the following in your .emacs (or init.el):

(eval-after-load 'paredit
  '(progn
     (require 'paredit-viper-compat)
     (paredit-viper-compat)))

This will apply the paredit-viper-compat fixes only when paredit
is active.

User key customizations:
If you want to add your own keybindings in addition to the ones
provided by paredit-viper-compat, you can do so using
the function paredit-viper-add-local-keys.
Usage is (paredit-viper-add-local-keys STATE KEYS);
where STATE is one of 'all-states, 'vi-state, 'insert-state, or 'emacs-state.
Insert a statement like the following inside the (eval-after-load ...)
form above:

(paredit-viper-add-local-keys 'all-states  ; or 'insert-state, etc.
                              '((\"\\C-w\" . paredit-backward-kill-word)
                                ;; ... more keys ...
                                ))

Complete setup combining the above examples:

(eval-after-load 'paredit
  '(progn
     (require 'paredit-viper-compat)
     (paredit-viper-compat)
     (paredit-viper-add-local-keys 'all-states
                                   '((\"\\C-w\" . paredit-backward-kill-word)
                                     ;; ... more keys ...
                                     ))))

Changelog:
0.1 - 2009-08-15 - Initial release.

TODO:
* XEmacs compatibility - paredit uses a variable `paredit-forward-delete-keys'
  which provides different values for GNU Emacs vs XEmacs. I could
  not figure out how to use that value correctly in the code below,
  so ended up hardcoding the values for GNU Emacs (\"<delete>\" and
  \"<deletechar>\").

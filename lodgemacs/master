This package was inspired Sebastian Wiesner's pastemacs, found at
<http://bitbucket.org/lunar/pastemacs/>, and grew out of a desire
to paste to a local instance of LodgeIt using an environment without
Python 2.5 (and thus Pymacs) available.

lodgemacs has the ability to communicate with arbitrary LodgeIt
instances, along with support for pasting from buffers, regions, or
rectangles, and yanking pastes to the current buffer or a new buffer.
It also will diff two pastes.

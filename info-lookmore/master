 :commentary "\
This is some more stuff for `info-lookup-symbol' -- a couple of specific
manuals to add and a couple of mode setups.

Functions adding manuals are `interactive' you can use M-x whatever to
have it just for the current session.

There's only a handful of manual-specific functions.  For anything else
see `info-lookmore-add-doc'.  Usually you have to find the node name for
the index, then check whether entries can be used directly or need a bit
of mangling.  The easiest is when there's a separate \"Functions\" or
\"Functions and Variables\" index.  See `info-lookup-alist' for the
details.")

 :commentary "\
This is some more stuff for `info-lookup-symbol' -- some specific manuals
to add and a couple of mode setups.

Functions adding manuals are `interactive' you can M-x whatever to have
it just for the current session.

For manuals not covered see `info-lookmore-add-doc'.  Usually you have to
find the node name for the index, then check whether entries can be used
directly or need mangling.  The easiest is when there's a separate
\"Functions\" or \"Functions and Variables\" index.  See `info-lookup-alist'
for the details.")

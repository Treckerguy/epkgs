You may have seen the `ido-everywhere' variable in ido.el and got
excited that you could use ido completion for everything. Then you
were probably disappointed when you realized that it only applied
to *file names* and nothing else. Well, ido-ubiquitous is here to
fulfill the original promise and let you use ido completion for
(almost) any command that uses `completing-read' to offer you a
choice of several alternatives.

This even works in M-x, but for that, you might prefer the \"smex\"
package instead.")

Perform conversion of some Latin-1 (same as iso8859-1) to equivalent
7-bit ascii sequences when possible.  I wrote this for converting mail
and news article reply buffers so they would not contain 8bit characters
needlessly.  Otherwise, the buffer has to be converted to
quoted-printable before sending, and that makes it harder to read for
the recipient if they do not have a MIME-aware reader.

These functions should not be used carelessly.  Sometimes it is not
appropriate to convert the original text of someone's message, and
sometimes there is nothing to gain since other 8-bit characters may be
present anyway.  One possible suggestion is to do something like:

   (add-hook 'mail-citation-hook
             #'(lambda (&optional beg end)
                 (lat1conv-to-ascii-query beg end t)
                 (and (lat1conv-other-8bit-in-region-p beg end)
                      (message \"warning: 8-bit chars in included text.\"))))

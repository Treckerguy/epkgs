This is an interface to the mairix mail search engine.  Mairix is
written by Richard Curnow and is licensed under the GPL.  See the
home page for details:

http://www.rpcurnow.force9.co.uk/mairix/

Features of mairix.el:

* Query mairix with a search term.
* Currently supported Emacs mail programs: RMail, Gnus (mbox only),
  and VM.
* Generate search queries using graphical widgets.
* Generate search queries based on currently displayed mail.
* Save regularly used searches in your .emacs customize section.
* Major mode for viewing, editing and querying saved searches.
* Update mairix database.

Please note: There are currently no pre-defined key bindings, since
I guess these would depend on the used mail program.  See the docs
for an overview of the provided interactive functions.

Attention Gnus users: If you use Gnus with maildir or nnml, you
should use the native Gnus back end nnmairix.el instead, since it
has more features and is better integrated with Gnus.  This
interface is essentially a stripped down version of nnmairix.el.

Currently, RMail, Gnus (with mbox files), and VM are supported as
mail programs, but it is pretty easy to interface it with other
ones as well.  Please see the docs and the source for details.
In a nutshell: include your favourite mail program in
`mairix-mail-program' and write functions for
`mairix-display-functions' and `mairix-get-mail-header-functions'.
If you have written such functions for your Emacs mail program of
choice, please let me know, so that I can eventually include them
in future version of mairix.el.")

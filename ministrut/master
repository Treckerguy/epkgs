 :commentary "\
Emacs supports using a `default-minibuffer-frame' whose minibuffer
window is used by all frames that do not have such a window.  This
frame does not need to contain any other windows but when created
as described in the elisp info pages behaves like any other X11
window.

This package creates a dedicated minibuffer frame and also removes
it's X11 window decoration and sets it up as an X11 strut.

This is an alpha release and not all desired features have been
implemented yet.  If you would like to try it anyway add something
like this to your init file:

(add-to-list 'load-path \"/path/to/ministrut/\")
(require 'ministrut)
(setq mstrut-minibuffer-frame-alist
      '((left         .  853)
        (top          . 1600)
        (width        .  190)
        (height       .    1)
        (strut-bottom .   18)
        (left-fringe  .    0)
        (right-fringe .    0)))
(ministrut-mode 1)

I use this with a screen resolution of 2560x1600 and the window
manager wmii.  Also note that I do not use the whole wide of the
screen to display the minibuffer.

Your window manager might have to be configure too.  For wmii add
this to the tagrules:

/Emacs Minibuffer/ -> ~

Previously I have created `xmonad.el' which had more features but was
tailored towards xmonad only.  Since I have switched back to wmii and
would like to try other window managers as well I have decided to write
this library instead, which theoretically should be usable with any
window manager.

However at least xmonad does focus the minibuffer frame when reading
input from it which actually is not correct.  Similar problems are to
be expected with other window managers as well.")

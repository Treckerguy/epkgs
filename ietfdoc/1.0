This module allows various IETF documents such as RFCs, internet drafts,
BCPs etc to be retrieved. I based this off the RFC retrieval code that was
posted to the gnu.emacs.sources newsgroup sometime ago. I have spiffed it up
to support retrieval of other IETF documents such as Internet Drafts, FYIs
and BCPs, support customization etc.

Usage:

Setup the following in your .emacs:

(autoload 'rfc \"ietfdoc\" nil t)
(autoload 'idraft \"ietfdoc\" nil t)
(autoload 'internet-draft \"ietfdoc\" nil t)
(autoload 'bcp \"ietfdoc\" nil t)
(autoload 'fyi \"ietfdoc\" nil t)

The following functions are available for usage:

M-x rfc - To retrieve the RFC index, an RFC by name or search the RFC index
          for a matching pattern.

M-x idraft - To retrieve the Internet draft index, an Internet draft
             (without knowing the latest version number) by name or, search
             the Internet draft for a matching pattern.

M-x bcp    - To retrieve the BCP index, a BCP by name or search the BCP index
             for a matching pattern. (BCP - Best Common Practice)

M-x fyi    - To retrieve the FYI index, an FYI by name or search the FYI
             index for a matching pattern. (FYI - For Your Information)

Examples:

M-x rfc 1024 - Retrieves the RFC 1024
M-x rfc      - Retrieves the entire RFC index
M-x rfc MPLS - Throws up a match buffer with list of all RFCs whose title
               contains the keyword \"MPLS\". User can select the
               corresponding RFC.
M-x idraft   - Retrieves the entire Internet Draft index
M-x idraft draft-ietf-rsvp-proxy - Retrieves the latest version of the ID
                                   whose title is draft-ietf-rsvp-proxy

The user can configure the following parameters:

    The path where the IETF document repository is located.
    The path where a local cached copy of the doucments exist.
    The path to the IETF document index file (not all places have this under
    the relevant document directory) for all different IETF documents.
    If case sensitive matching is to be used.")

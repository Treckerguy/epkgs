 :commentary "\
This is some functions to add or remove patterns filladapt uses for
paragraph filling.  They're designed to go in a mode hook and operate
buffer-local, but can also be used interactively for occasional changes
to the patterns.

The setups work whether or not filladapt has loaded yet and do nothing if
you haven't turned on filladapt, or for that matter if you don't have it
at all.")

Usage:
  Instead of using

  (require 'yasnippet)
  (setq yas/root-directory snippet-directory)
  (yas/load-directory yas/root-directory)

  which takes some time on initial loading, use

  (require 'yas-jit)
  (setq yas/root-directory snippet-directory)
  (yas/jit-load)

  For yasnippet 0.6 the root directory is something like:
  (setq yas/root-directory \"~/.emacs.d/snippets/text-mode/\")

  For yasnippet 0.7 the root directory is something like:

  (setq yas/root-directory \"~/.emacs.d/snippets/\");;

  This is because the root directory assumes that each load-path
  contains directories of modes with snippets. 

  Also note that yasnippet requires something in the hash,
  otherwise it loads everything.  Therefore text-mode snippets are
  loaded by default.

  This will probably not be put in the trunk of yasnippet.")

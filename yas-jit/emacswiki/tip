Usage:
  Instead of using 

  (require 'yasnippet)
  (setq yas/root-directory snippet-directory)
  (yas/load-directory yas/root-directory)

  which takes some time on initial loading, use

  (require 'yas-jit)
  (setq yas/root-directory snippet-directory)
  (yas/jit-load)

  Note this works assuming that each load directory contains a list
  of modes. Currently the release version of yasnippet does not use
  this paradigm. However the svn trunk does.

  Also note that yasnippet requires something in the hash,
  otherwise it loads everything.  Therefore text-mode snippets are
  loaded by default.")

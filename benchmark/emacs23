Utilities for timing the execution of forms, including the time
taken for GC.  Note that prior to timing code you may want to
ensure things like:  there has just been a GC, the relevant code is
already loaded (so that there's no overhead from autoloading etc.),
and the code is compiled if appropriate (but see
`benchmark-run-compiled').")

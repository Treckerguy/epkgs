Overview
========

This library provides minor mode `linear-undo-mode' which makes
undo and redo command not to record undo/redo elements in
tree structure, by inhibiting to record undo/redo operations
to buffer-undo-list.

I believe this minor mode brings intuitive way to undo/redo.

Additionally, while `linear-undo-mode' is on, count of pending
undo/redo elements will be displayed after each undo/redo
command is executed.

To install this library, save this file to a directory in your
`load-path' (you can view the current `load-path' using \"C-h v
load-path RET\" within Emacs), then add the following line to your
.emacs startup file:

   (require 'linear-undo)

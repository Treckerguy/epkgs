This package provides a number of wizards to help you create
flashcard decks based on a number of existing dictionaries.
currently supported are all dictionaries in the KANJIDIC and EDICT
format, ie. KANJIDIC, EDICT, ENUMDIC, JDDICT, COMPDIC.

Use `flashmaker-kanjidic-filter' to create a new flashcard deck
based on a KANJIDIC format file.

Use `flashmaker-edict-filter' to create a new flashcard deck based
on a KANJIDIC format file, and an EDICT format file.  The KANJIDIC
file will be used to classify all characters, and then the
expressions in the EDICT file will be filtered according to this
classification, thus producing a subset of the EDICT File limited
to the kanji you want to practice.

When reading the files, the encoding can be problematic.  If your
Emacs does not recognize EUC-JP automatically, I recommend the
following addition to your init file:

(add-to-list 'auto-coding-alist '(\"edict\\\\'\" . euc-jp))
(add-to-list 'auto-coding-alist '(\"kanjidic\\\\'\" . euc-jp))

When saving the files, I recommend the coding system iso-2022-jp.

In debian, use \"apt-get install kanjidic\" for a large dictionary of
Japanese kanji including a document explaining the format of the
dictionary file.

You can use flashcard decks to practice using flashcard.el by
Jorgen Schaefer.")

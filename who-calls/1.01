 :commentary "\
`who-calls' displays all known callers of an Emacs Lisp function.
To bind it to key, say `C-c C-w', add something like this to your
.emacs:

  (autoload 'who-calls \"who-calls\" nil t)
  (define-key emacs-lisp-mode-map \"\\C-c\\C-w\" 'who-calls)

To actually generate and save the call information, you need to
load this file when compiling the project, e.g. \"-l who-calls.el\",
probably by modifying the Makefile -- for Gnus it would be this
line:

FLAGS = -batch -q -no-site-file -l who-calls.el -l $(srcdir)/dgnushack.el")

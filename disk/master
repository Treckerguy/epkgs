This program provides an alternative disk mounting tool. It is
implemented as a STUN module.

It would probably not be hard to make this configurable so that it
works with other operating systems. If you use another operating
system and would like to help me get it working there, let me know.

Features:
 - Scan for attached USB Mass Storage devices and find their UUID's
   (see `disk-scan-disks')
 - Assign unique names to devices (see `disk-disks-alist')
 - Automatically create and configure mount points and UUID's in /etc/fstab
   (see `disk-write-fstab', `disk-scan-and-configure')
 - Mount/unmount disks interactively, with auto-completion
   (see `disk-mount' and `disk-unmount')

Future:
 - TODO Report new disks when hotplugged? (periodic scan, automount?)
 - TODO Configure USB Audio devices with ALSA/JACK. use jack.el!
 - TODO fix mount point permissions")

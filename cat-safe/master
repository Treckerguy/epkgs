Two steps,

  1. Copy this file to somewhere in your load-path.

  2. Add the following line to your .emacs file,

    (require 'cat-safe)

If you have a cat you may sometimes find that your cat has wandered
across your keyboard, typing garbage into whatever application has
focus. This script will protect your Emacs buffers from this by
detecting cat-like typing and switching to a junk buffer, sending
keystrokes there instead.

To return to your work, just kill the junk buffer.")

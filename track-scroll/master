GNU Emacs comes with mouse-drag.el which implements a feature I've
been wanting for years but doesn't work with XEmacs. *grr*
Loading this file enables the dragging of the window using the
middle mouse button. Holding the control key at the same time calls
a different function which behaves more like the scrollbar does.
It's probably best to just try it yourself and see what happens.
This abandons drag and drop functionality which is usually called
when dragging the middle mouse button

After Garret came up with a third function introducing a third kind
of behaviour I at least got rid of the hardcoded keys.
Nevertheless, I'd much prefer _one_ backend function (which would
probably be a mixture of track-scroll-drag-scalable and
track-scroll-fullwin) with a smart scaling factor function which
would reflect the three scrolling mechanisms.

Problems:
- horizontal scrolling
- customizable sensitivities for both directions?
- what about info (and others?) that override the mouse-track
  setting for their buffers? I really hate info for that.")

This file contains functionality to make the help provided by the
help-echo text or overlay property available to the keyboard user.
It also supports a more keyboard oriented alternative to
`help-echo', namely a new text or overlay property `kbd-help'.

It provides facilities to access the local help available at point
either on demand, using the command `display-local-help', or
automatically after a suitable idle time, through the customizable
variable `help-at-pt-display-when-idle'.

You can get a more global overview of the local help available in
the buffer, using the commands `scan-buf-next-region' and
`scan-buf-previous-region', which move to the start of the next or
previous region with available local help and print the help found
there.

Suggested key bindings:

(global-set-key [C-tab] 'scan-buf-next-region)
(global-set-key [C-M-tab] 'scan-buf-previous-region)

You do not have to do anything special to use the functionality
provided by this file, because all important functions autoload.")

 :commentary "\
Change variable `mode-line-position' so that the following changes
 are made to the mode line:

 1. Highlight the column number when the current column is greater
    than limit `modelinepos-column-limit'.  Face
    `modelinepos-column-warning' is used for the highlighting.

 2. Make `size-indication-mode' show the size of the region,
    instead of the buffer size, whenever the region is active.

 Note: Loading this library changes the default definition of
       `mode-line-position'.

 To use this library, put this in your Emacs init file (~/.emacs):

   (require 'modeline-posn)

 To show the column number highlighting, turn on Column Number
 mode.  You can do that in your Emacs init file this way:

   (column-number-mode 1)

 To show the buffer and region size indication in the mode line,
 turn on Size Indication.  You can do that in your Emacs init file
 this way:

   (size-indication-mode 1) ; Turn on Size Indication mode.

 You can customize `modelinepos-column-limit' or bind it to
 different values for different modes.")

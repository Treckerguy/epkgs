 :commentary "\
The ancestral gdb.el was by W. Schelter <wfs@rascal.ics.utexas.edu>.
It was later rewritten by rms.  Some ideas were due to Masanobu.  Grand
Unification (sdb/dbx support) by Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com> Barry
Warsaw <bwarsaw@cen.com> hacked the mode to use comint.el.  Shane Hartman
<shane@spr.com> added support for xdb (HPUX debugger).  Rick Sladkey
<jrs@world.std.com> wrote the GDB command completion code.  Dave Love
<d.love@dl.ac.uk> added the IRIX kluge, re-implemented the Mips-ish variant
and added a menu. Brian D. Carlstrom <bdc@ai.mit.edu> combined the IRIX
kluge with the gud-xdb-directories hack producing gud-dbx-directories.
Derek L. Davies <ddavies@world.std.com> added support for jdb (Java
debugger.)")

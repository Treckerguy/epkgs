 :commentary "\
This package is a major mode for editing nroff source code.  It knows
about various nroff constructs, ms, mm, and me macros, and will fill
and indent paragraphs properly in their presence.  It also includes
a command to count text lines (excluding nroff constructs), a command
to center a line, and movement commands that know how to skip macros.

Paragraph filling and line-counting currently don't respect comments,
as they should.")

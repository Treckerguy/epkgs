 :commentary "\
The Emacs Lisp Lisp is available at
 http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/sje30/emacs/ell.html

 If Stephen changes the layout of his web page, this package may
 stop to work correctly.  You may then need to upgrade this
 package.

After loading this file, just do \"M-x ell-packages\" to view the
list in its own buffer.
Use a prefix argument (i.e. \"C-u M-x ell-packages\") to sort by
author name.

(New in 1.1)

Retrieves information from ell.xml instead of ell.html. Old method relied on
regular expressions for parsing and was skipping some entries.

(New in 1.0)

Packages added to the ELL since the last time you called
\"ell-packages\" will be marked with a tag (\"<New>\").  This is
achieved by storing relevant information about the last time you
accessed ELL in a file.  If you delete this file, the next time you
access the ELL, all files will be marked as new once more.  If
ell-occur-if-new-found is t, an *Occur* buffer will automatically
show you the new entries.

The elib package is required for cache management (using the
avltree facility).  If you do not have elib, get it from any GNU
mirror, such as
ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/systems/gnu/emacs/elib-1.0.tar.gz

Variables.

Set ell-locate to t (default nil) if you want emacs to
indicate which lisp files are already available on your system.

Set ell-goto-addr to t (default nil) if you want to turn the
URLs into hyperlinks using the goto-addr package.

Set ell-last-read-filename to the name of the file where you want
to store information from the last time the ELL site was accessed.

To Do:

+ Do the http fetching in the background so emacs is not
  freezed on slow connections

+ Take consideration for the accented character in the sort by
  author.

+ replace sort* with something else so the need for cl.el is
  no more required. (is this really necessary?)

+ Highlight packages already somewhere on your local lisp path.")

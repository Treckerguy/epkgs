Random grab bag of extras for \\\\[python-mode] and
\\\\[inferior-python-mode].

This package was made to improve Emacs' existing python mode,
`python.el'.  Unlike packages like ropemacs this module does not have
any mandatory external dependencies.


Several different helper functions were added to:

 * Let you add parameters to the function block you're editing in
   using the minibuffer;

 * Send the expression under point to either 'dir' or 'help' in
   inferior python without disrupting your current input.

 * Add basic syntax highlighting to inferior python.

 * Shift regions of code around and reindents according to the
   indentation depth of that block


How to use

By default several commands are bound to various 'C-c' keybinds.

In \\\\[python-mode]:

Misc

<RET> - Now rebound to `newline-and-indent' -- as it should be.

C-S-<up>/<down> - Shifts a region up/down intelligently,
reindenting as necessary.

Refactor

C-c C-p - Calls `python-mp-add-parameter' which will prompt you for
a parameter to add to the function point is currently in.  If you
are not in a function body an error is raised.


Extract...

Extracts the string/s-exp/expression at point to the top of the
current...

  C-c C-e C-b - block

  C-c C-e C-d - def

  C-c C-e C-c - class

In inferior python mode:

Inferior Python

C-c C-d - Invokes `python-mp-send-dir'.  Sends a dir(EXPR) command
where EXPR is the expression at point.  It will preserve your
current input.

C-d C-h - Invokes `python-mp-send-help'.  Sends a help(EXPR) command
where EXPR is the expressio nat point.  It will also preserve your
current input.

Highlighting - Strings are now highlighted using a special \"safety\"
font locker to prevent the colors from 'bleeding'.


Installation:

Put `python-extras.el' somewhere in your `load-path'.

Now add the following line to your .emacs or init.el:

(require 'python-extras)")

This is an extension to the completing-read commands in the
minibuffer.  It allows you to cycle through the current list of
completions.  This works when changing buffers, with any command
which reads a function or variable name, or with a programmer
specified completion list.  It even works with functions which
read a file name!  In addition, if you have part of a name already
typed in, cycle-mini will use that string to narrow down the matches
and will only cycle through the completions which contain that
initial substring.

Default bindings:

^P,[up]	Display previous matching completion.
^N,[down]	Display next matching completion.
TAB          Accept currently displayed completion and move cursor
             to end of line.  If no completion is displayed, call
             minibuffer-complete as usual.

Typing any movement key will also accept the current completion.
Any editing key will clear the currently displayed completion
and will then change the remaining input as expected.

Installation:

Byte-compile, then put this file in one of your elisp load
directories and add the following line to your .emacs file

(load \"cycle-mini\")")

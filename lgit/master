 :commentary "\
Support for conveniently calling git from elisp libraries.

Several solutions exist that provide an interface to git from within
Emacs.  However if you want to use the low-level functions provided by
these libraries in your own code as opposed to using their front-end
commands to interact with git as a user (as they are intended to) this
results in quite verbose incantations.

This library does not try to do everything for everyone - instead it
just provides the basic functionality that I need, in several of my
libraries.  Creating this library allowed me to remove the almost
identical git functions from all of them.  Since the libary name
`egit' was already taken this library is called `lgit' instead.
Incidentally this also emphasizes the fact that this library is
intended to be used by other libraries, not as a front-end.")

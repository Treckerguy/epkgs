I can't freaking believe this is still not part of Emacs.
Maybe it could be done better--this is pretty basic, really.
I mean, sure you can't trust the word count for things like
sending rocket ships to the moon, but frankly, is it that
important?  Anyway, do M-x wc RET and it should pretty much
work.  It uses the current syntax table's definition of a
word.

Code.

This is the logic, and can be used in a program.  The other
functions use this interactively in various ways.")

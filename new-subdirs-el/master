tehom-normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path's behavior is
different than normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path.  It
assumes directories that have their own subdirs.el are handled by
that subdirs.el and therefore doesn't explore them.  It also assumes
that the absence or presence of .nosearch indicates whether such a
directory-tree's root should be part of load-path or not.")

This package provides a text based interface to the menubar.
In order to test this as you see this file, proceed as follows:
  1: Load this package:  M-x eval-buffer
  2: Browse the menubar: M-x tmenu-menubar
  3: You see something like the following:
     -------------------------------------------------------------
     Click mouse-2 on a completion to select it.
     In this buffer, type RET to select the completion near point.
     
     Possible completions are:
     b > Buffers                        f > Files
     t > Tools                          e > Edit
     s > Search                         m > Mule
     E > Emacs-Lisp                     h > Help
     -------------------------------------------------------------
  4: Press the first character (e.g. b for Buffers, E for Emacs-Lisp)
     to select the menu item.
     Enter C-g to exit the menu without selecting any item.


What's the differences between tmenu.el and tmm.el

 I mainly wrote this package to lean the differences in the menu APIs
 between GNU Emacs and XEmacs, so I'm afraid there's no earth-shattering
 features that tmenu.el can be proud of.

 tmm.el
  * a standard package bundled with GNU Emacs.
  * is lightweight.
  * 

 tmenu.el
  * runs on GNU Emacs and XEmacs.
  * allow the user to move around the menu hierarchy.
  * displays radio/toggle buttons.
  * 


Requirements:

Tested with FSF Emacs 20.7.2 and XEmacs 21.1.12.")

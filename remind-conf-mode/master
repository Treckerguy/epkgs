 :commentary "\
Use this mode to help with the configuration of remind configuration files.
Put (require 'remind-conf-mode) in your .emacs file
or (autoload 'remind-conf-mode \"remind-conf-mode\" \"Mode to help with remind files\" t)
also put (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.rem\\\\'\" . remind-conf-mode)) and
(setq auto-mode-alist
    (cons '(\".reminders$\" . remind-conf-mode) auto-mode-alist))
if you want to have the mode work automatically when you open a remind configuration file.

If you want to use the auto-complete stuff, you will need to download and install the
auto-complete library from  http://www.cx4a.org/pub/auto-complete.el and put
(require 'auto-complete) in your Emacs with
(add-hook 'remind-conf-mode-hook
 (lambda ()
   (make-local-variable 'ac-sources)
   (setq ac-sources '(ac-remind-conf ac-remind-builtin-variables ac-remind-builtin-functions))
   (auto-complete t)))
  in your .emacs file

  PS.  you could add ac-source-abbrev ac-source-words-in-buffer to have abbrevs and
  other words in buffer auto-complete too")

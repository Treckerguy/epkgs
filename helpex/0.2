This file provides additions to the C-h help prefix.

To install it, (auto)load this file and run (helpex-setup-keys).

This will add the following key bindings to the C-h prefix (As a
mnemonic, think about what the same commands with non-capital
letters do):

C-h A        `apropos'
C-h D        `find-function'
C-h V        `find-variable'
C-h K        `find-function-on-key'
C-h 4 f      `find-function-other-window'
C-h 5 f      `find-function-other-frame'
C-h 4 k      `find-variable-other-window'
C-h 5 k      `find-variable-other-frame'
C-h L        `helpex-find-library'
C-h o        `helpex-locate-library'
C-h M        `helpex-show-keymap'

Additionally, it changes the behaviour of Info-goto-node, so that,
if it is called interactively, the entered string starts with `('
and does not contain any `)', info file names are auto-completed.

Example: If you press C-h i g ( e m TAB, it will---if you don't have
other info files starting with `em'---complete it to `(emacs)'.")

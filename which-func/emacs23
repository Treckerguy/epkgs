 :commentary "\
This package prints name of function where your current point is
located in mode line. It assumes that you work with imenu package
and imenu--index-alist is up to date.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
Really this package shows not \"function where the current point is
located now\", but \"nearest function which defined above the current
point\". So if your current point is located after end of function
FOO but before begin of function BAR, FOO will be displayed in mode
line.
- if two windows display the same buffer, both windows
  show the same `which-func' information.

TODO LIST
---------
    1. Dependence on imenu package should be removed.  Separate
function determination mechanism should be used to determine the end
of a function as well as the beginning of a function.
    2. This package should be realized with the help of overlay
properties instead of imenu--index-alist variable.")

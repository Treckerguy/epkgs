 :commentary "\
This  extension  modifies  the  format  of  the  mode lines under the Sunrise
Commander panes so they display only the paths to the current directories (or
the tail if the whole path is longer can be displayed on the mode line) and a
small icon  indicating  the  current  mode  (normal,  virtual,  synchronized,
editable) of its respective pane.

The regular mode line format remains available: press C-c m to toggle between
one format and the other.

The  extension  is  provided  as a minor mode, so you can enable / disable it
totally by issuing the command (M-x) sr-modeline.

This is version 2 $Rev: 309 $ of the Sunrise Commander Modeline Extension.

It  was  written  on GNU Emacs 23 on Linux, and tested on GNU Emacs 22 and 23
for Linux and on EmacsW32 (version 22) for  Windows.

Installation and Usage:

1) Put this file somewhere in your emacs load-path.

2)  Add  a  (require  ’sunrise‐x‐modeline)  expression  to  your  .emacs file
somewhere after the (require ’sunrise‐commander) one.

3) Evaluate the new expression, or reload your .emacs file, or restart emacs.

4) Enjoy ;-)")

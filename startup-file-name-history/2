This is a spot of code to get filenames passed on the Emacs command line
added to `file-name-history' (as well as opened in buffers in the usual
way).

savehist.el can be used at the same time if desired.  `savehist-mode'
initializes `file-name-history' when .emacs is evaluated, and then
startup-file-name-history.el runs later during command line processing
and adds to whatever savehist loaded (which is what you want).")

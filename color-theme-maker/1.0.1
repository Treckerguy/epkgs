 :commentary "\
This package makes it easier to make subthemes.  If you like the
jde faces of theme A, the erc faces from theme B, and generally
prefer theme color-theme-gray30, then proceed as follows:

Install theme A, call M-x color-theme-maker, provide \"jde\" as
regexp and \"my-jde-subtheme\" as name, then install theme B, call
M-x color-theme-maker, provide \"erc\" as regexp and
\"my-erc-subtheme\" as name.  Save the two buffers as
my-jde-subtheme.el and my-erc-subtheme.el.  In your .emacs, add:

  (require 'color-theme)
  (color-theme-gray30)
  (setq color-theme-is-cumulative t)
  (require 'my-jde-subtheme)
  (my-jde-subtheme)
  (require 'my-erc-subtheme)
  (my-erc-subtheme)

MH-E is an Emacs interface to the MH mail system.

MH-E is supported in GNU Emacs 21 and 22, as well as XEmacs 21
(except for versions 21.5.9-21.5.16). It is compatible with MH
versions 6.8.4 and higher, all versions of nmh, and GNU mailutils
1.0 and higher. Gnus is also required; version 5.10 or higher is
recommended.

MH (Message Handler) is a powerful mail reader. See
http://rand-mh.sourceforge.net/.

N.B. MH must have been compiled with the MHE compiler flag or several
features necessary for MH-E will be missing from MH commands, specifically
the -build switch to repl and forw.

How to use:
  M-x mh-rmail to read mail.  Type C-h m there for a list of commands.
  C-u M-x mh-rmail to visit any folder.
  M-x mh-smail to send mail.  From within the mail reader, \"s\" works, too.

Your .emacs might benefit from these bindings:
  (global-set-key \"\\C-cr\" 'mh-rmail)
  (global-set-key \"\\C-xm\" 'mh-smail)
  (global-set-key \"\\C-x4m\" 'mh-smail-other-window)

If Emacs can't find mh-rmail or mh-smail, add the following to ~/.emacs:
  (require 'mh-autoloads)

If you want to customize MH-E before explicitly loading it, add this:
  (require 'mh-cus-load)

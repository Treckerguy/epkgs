 :commentary "\
Minibuffer input completion and cycling of completion candidates.

 Input completion takes as input a string and returns a name that
 contains the input string.  This library enables minibuffer
 cycling of completion candidates, and provides additional support
 for input completion.

 Two kinds of completion are offered here, which are distinguished
 by how the input string is matched against the completed name:

  - Prefix completion - The input string is a prefix of the
                        completed name.  This is the usual Emacs
                        completion.

  - Apropos completion - The input string is a regular expression
                         that matches somewhere (anywhere) within
                         the completed name.  You can think of the
                         name as having been returned by `apropos'
                         (except it also works for file and buffer
                         names).

 Files `icicles-doc1.el' and `icicles-doc2.el' contain the doc for
 Icicles, including how to install and use Icicles.  You can also
 read the Icicles doc, in formatted form, on the Emacs-Wiki Web
 site: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Icicles.  Emacs Wiki
 also has a few addtional pages about Icicles.  In particular, if
 you are new to Emacs, as well as Icicles, see this page:
 http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/EmacsNewbieWithIcicles.

 See also: Library `lacarte.el', which lets you execute menu
 commands, cycling and completing them.  It is not part of Icicles,
 but it is greatly enhanced by Icicles.")

Store file local variables without changing the file's contents. Add the
variable's symbol to `properties-list', and the variable will be
automatically saved and restored.

In addition, overlays can be stored too -- see `properties-overlays'.

By default, the properties of file =/there/here/this.txt= will be stored
in =/there/here/.props/this.txt= -- see `properties-subdir'.

Installation: Put (require 'properties) (properties-install) into your
startup/user init file.


*** Commands

`properties-add' :: Add a variable to the file's property list.

`properties-remove' :: Remove a variable from the file's property list.

`properties-write' :: Write the property file.

`properties-install', `properties-deinstall' :: Add and remove
properties.el specific hooks.


*** Variables

`properties-list' :: A list of properties that should be stored in the
property file.

`properties-overlays' :: A list of symbols or plists identifying overlays
that should be stored.

`properties-overlay-ignored-properties' :: Ignore these properties when
dumping overlays.

`properties-file' :: A buffer local variable defining the properties
file -- relative to the current buffer's/file's location. Use this to
force the use of a non-standard properties file.

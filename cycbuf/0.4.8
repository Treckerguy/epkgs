 :commentary "\
This is a combination of some features of swbuff-x (Kahlil (Kal)
HODGSON <dorge@tpg.com.au>), which is a modification to swbuff
(David Ponce) and bs (Olaf Sylvester <olaf@geekware.de>)

I really liked the nicely layouted and composed buffer-selection
buffer of bs.  However, also fast switching buffers with one
key-stroke and showing a temporary buffer with a buffer list (with
hide timeout) a la swbuff is nice.  So I combined both's
advantages.

Some current problems are documented in the code.")

 :commentary "\
This mode provides syntax highlighting for LESS CSS files, plus
optional support for flymake and compilation of .less files to .css
files at the time they are saved: use `less-css-compile-at-save' to
enable the latter.

Command line utility \"lessc\" is required if enabling flymake or
setting `less-css-compile-at-save' to t.  To install \"lessc\" using
the Node.js package manager, run \"npm install less\"

Also make sure the \"lessc\" executable is in emacs' PATH, example:
(setq exec-path (cons (expand-file-name \"~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin\") exec-path))
or customize `less-css-lessc-command' to point to your \"lessc\" executable.

`less-css-mode' is derived from `css-mode', and indentation of
nested blocks may not work correctly with versions of `css-mode'
other than that bundled with recent Emacs.

The original code for this mode was, in large part, written using
Anton Johansson's scss-mode as a template -- thanks Anton!

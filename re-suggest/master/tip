 :commentary "\
Say you discover a new, more efficient sequence of commands to do
something.  You want to start using it, but your muscle memory
continues to do it the old way.  Before long you forget the new
way, and continue doing things the old way.  With recs, Emacs can
recognize the old pattern when you use it, and suggest the new the
pattern, training you to be a better Emacs user.

recs.el is a simple command suggestion minor-mode.  It works by
recording the names of the commands you enter into a ring-like
string which is then matched against a list of command-pattern
regexps.  When a match is detected recs suggests a more efficient
way of doing things.  recs looks strictly at sequences of commands,
not sequences of keystrokes, avoiding complications resulting from
different keybindings in different modes.

The advantage of this approach is that we can match any command
sequence that a regexp is powerful enough to match.

The disadvantage of this approach is that we can only match command
sequences that a regexp is powerful enough to match.")

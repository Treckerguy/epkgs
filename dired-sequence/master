Media files, like image files and sound files are often named
according to numerical patterns.  Some types of operations on media
files are lossy, resulting in missing files, files not being named
in the intended order, etc.

One example is image files scanned from a book.  Each page gets a
file name like 0001.djvu for instance.  If the scanner accidentaly
double-feeds pages, image file names no longer match book page
numbers. Another example is converting compact discs to audio
files.

This library is intended to help fix issues like these.

Some concepts:

Sequence Expression: Used both for matching filenames, and generating
new filenames. Therefore a string compliant with the \"format\"
function rather than a normal regexp is used.  example \"00-%4d.djvu\" ,
\"%4d\" is interpreted for pattern matching.  This will match filenames
looking like \"00-0001.djvu\" etc.  

Gap: A gap in the sequential numbering of files, some files are
aparently missing in the middle of a sequence

Offset: Used when offseting sequential filenames up or down in
sequence.

TODO:

Maybe it would be useful with a more complete regexp syntax for mark
expressions, but so far the current syntax is convenient and has
worked well.

It would be nice to be able to set a bunch of section names in
one go, maybe similar to fsdired.")

When moving the cursor (with e.g the arrow keys or C-n, C-p, etc) and the
key is held down and auto-repeated, then start moving cursor in increasingly
larger steps.

Any command that takes a numeric argument as it s first arg (specified
by e.g. (interactive \"p\")) can be accelerated. But it is mostly only useful
to accelerate cursor movement commands that normally moves cursor a short
distance.

The feature is disabeled when recording (and executing) keyboard macros,
because timing information is not stored in macros.

Example

 (require 'accelerate)
 (accelerate previous-line 2)
 (accelerate next-line 2)
 (accelerate backward-char 3)
 (accelerate forward-char 3)
 (accelerate dired-previous-line 2)
 (accelerate dired-next-line 2)
 (accelerate speedbar-prev 2)
 (accelerate speedbar-next 2)

(If the command being accelerated is defined yet or not does not matter.
 E.g. when accelerating dired-next-line, (require 'dired) is not needed.)

todo: Problem accelerating backward-char and forward-char; defadvice does not
      take effect. (Is it because they are subs, and not functions?)")

This mode helps you to learn facts. To use it, just put the
following in your .emacs file:

(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.deck\\\\'\" . flashcard-mode))

Now open any file with a .deck extension (a new file will do). You
will now be put into flashcard. The first thing you need to do is
to add cards from any file, with either M-x flashcard-add-card, or
M-x flashcard-import-from-colon-file.

Now you should get questions asked from flashcard. Just save and
kill the buffer as usual. If you want to continue where you left
off, just open the buffer again like any other file.

CAVEAT: Your dialog with the program is NOT saved when you save the
buffer!

A full bells-and-whistles setup would include the following:

(add-hook 'flashcard-mode-hook
          'flashcard-add-scroll-to-bottom)
(add-hook 'flashcard-positive-feedback-functions
          'flashcard-feedback-highlight-answer)
(add-hook 'flashcard-positive-feedback-functions
          'flashcard-feedback-congratulate)
(add-hook 'flashcard-positive-feedback-functions
          'flashcard-method-leitner-positive-feedback)

xml-rpc.el is required to use this program.
It can be get from following URL.  (now, newest is rev 1.7)
http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/emacsweblogs/weblogger/lisp/xml-rpc.el

If you want to edit wiki pages with non-ASCII characters,
you need xml-rpc.el rev 1.7 or later.

Use XmlRpcPlugin r1735 or later.  Earlier versions has a problem
(see http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/845) on previewing.

emacs-w3m can be get from:
http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/index.html
Of course you must have w3m program because emacs-w3m use it.

Configuration:

 Step 1. Get and enable XmlRpcPlugin on your trac site.
         http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin

         Install and setup it with refering the page above.  Don't
         forget enabling plugin in trac.ini and adding permission
         to allow user accessing via XML-RPC.  For example, it is
         recommended to add 'XML_RPC' permission to 'authenticated'
         subject to allow XML-RPC access only for relyable users.

 Step 2. Set project information variable `trac-projects'
         in your .emacs.

         If you have a trac site frequently visit to edit, you can
         register the url of that site with alias name.  To do this
         use `trac-wiki-define-project' like this:

           (trac-wiki-define-project \"trac-hacks\"
                                     \"http://trac-hacks.org/\" t)

         1st argument is alias name which is used on selection.
         2nd arugment is actual url.  3rd optional argument indicates
         login is required for the site access.
         If you have multiple instance in one site, you can use
         `trac-wiki-define-multiple-projects'.
         Ex.
            (trac-wiki-define-multiple-projects
                  '(\"proj1\" \"proj2\" \"test\")
                   \"http://www.foo.bar.org/\" t)

         An example above is equivalent to three
         `trac-wiki-define-project' definition.

         Note: Old version of `trac-wiki.el' required XML-RPC
               end-point url for these functions.  Recent veresion
               of `trac-wiki.el', however, `trac-wiki.el` expects
               normal site url instead of end-point url.

 Step 3. Set proxy information.

         Url library gets proxy information via variable
         `url-proxy-services'.  It is well to set in your .emacs.

         See info of url pakage for more detail.
         Jump to info node by evaluating this:
           (Info-goto-node \"(url)Proxies\")

 Step 4. Set autoload and more.

         Set autoload definition in your .emacs for convenience:

          (autoload 'trac-wiki \"trac-wiki\"
                    \"Trac wiki editing entry-point.\" t)

         And load mule-ucs for Emacs 21.x user.")

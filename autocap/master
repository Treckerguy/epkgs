 :commentary "\
auto-capitalize-mode attempts to capitalize (only) the beginning of
sentences.  It uses the abbrev expansion hook.  You probably want to
put it on `text-mode-hook', i.e.
   (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'auto-capitalize-mode)
or via Custom.

Defining specific abbrevs can help too, and this file defines a
couple of useful hook functions, e.g.:
 (define-abbrev-table 'text-mode-abbrev-table
     (\"i'm\" \"I'm\")  ; ... egocentric
     (\"i've\" \"I've\")
     (\"i'd\" \"I'd\")
     (\"i'll\" \"I'll\")
     (\"i\" \"I\" autocap-not-at-stop)  ; not, e.g. in `i.e.'
     (\"emacs\" \"Emacs\" autocap-delimited))) ; arbitrary example

Normal abbrevs expanded at the start of a sentence get their first
word capitalized as you'd hope.")

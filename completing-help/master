This package enhances the completion mechanism of Emacs by
allowing you to display information on completions.

While entering an argument to a command which supports completion
in the minibuffer, by pressing `?', you see possible completions
of what you've entered so far. This is one of the standard features
of Emacs.

With this package, you can see not only possible completions, but
also information on them (e.g. docstrings of elisp variables.)

This package directly supports the following standard commands:

    bookmark-jump            (C-x r b)
    customize-group          (M-x customize-group, also on the menu-bar)
    customize-option         (M-x customize-option, also on the menu-bar)
    describe-function        (C-h f)
    describe-variable        (C-h v)
    execute-extended-command (M-x)
    find-function            (M-x find-function)
    find-variable            (M-x find-variable)
    setenv                   (M-x setenv)
    where-is                 (C-h w)

As for the other commands, this package can guess, to some extent,
what's relevant as help information, based on knowledge of the type
of argument you are entering, so your custom commands and other
standard commands might work right off the bat without requiring
any configuration on your part. You can also add support for a command
by defining a \"group\" (a property list) for it,
see \"How this package works\" section.")

zen-mode is Emacs in fullscreen without toolbar and menubar
the function toggles between previous state of features and zen

Please see BUG list below if Zen doesnt behave as expected.

I bind zen-mode to f11 like this:
(global-set-key [f11] 'zen-mode)

TODO:

- BUG: Currently Zen mode cant see the difference between a maximized
frame and a fullscreen frame. This is because of a limitation in
Emacs, which will be fixed future-ish. The end result is that
currently Zen will probably not do what you expect if you enter zen
while in a maximized frame. 

- BUG: There are some problems in the Compiz WM, (and maybe other WM:s)
regarding fullscreen: When selecting another workspace temporarily
and going back, Emacs does not cover the wm panels as it should.
This can be resolved with alt-tab a bit, but its annoying.  In
Metacity it works well. Maybe Zen could learn to work around these
WM:s

- Improvement: Zen-master mode, like writeroom mode. (c-u m-x
zen-mode), which isn't customizable, it just turns all distractions
off, including minibuffer.

- Improvement: Levels of Zen-ness. Quickly enter zen with different
predetermined settings

- Improvement: Optionaly advice some modes like ERC so as not to
 interrupt while in Zen, also dont Gnus while in Zen. You are
 supposed to concentrate :)

- Improvement: Optional procrastination inhibitor. Enter Zen and dont leave until
youv'e actually produced someting useful. For instance, 15 minutes
must pass and some useful buffer must grow by a number of bytes
before you can begin wasting time again.

BUG: doesnt remember previous window size and position always")

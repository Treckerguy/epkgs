 :commentary "\
This spot of code to lets M-x ffap find a file attached as a Gnus message
meta-language (MML) part, as per `C-c C-a' (mml-attach-part) when
composing a message.  Eg.

    <#part type=\"text/plain\" filename=\"/foo/bar.txt\" disposition=attachment>
    <#/part>

Of course ffap can already follow it when point is right on the filename,
but ffap-mml.el makes it work when point is somewhere else in this form,
like as the start of the line.")

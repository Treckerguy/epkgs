Produces a graph of the entire wiki.  The graph is described using
the dot language.  See http://www.graphviz.org/ for source and binary
distributions.  There are two tools available: dot for directed
graphs and neato for undirected graphs.  Customize `wiki-graph-type'
to control the output.

In order to convert the dot file to postscript (see the respective
man pages for other formats):

$ neato -Tps -o wiki.ps wiki.dot

I use the -Elen=1.3 parameter to make edges longer.

Please: If you have interesting ideas about how to improve usability
of the resulting graph, tell me all about it!  :) Problems I'm
having: How to produce a gif file -- it seems I have to install fonts
somewhere but I don't know how.  How to increase the size of the
resulting postscript file -- most of the time only part of the graph
is visible.")

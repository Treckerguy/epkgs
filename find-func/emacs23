The funniest thing about this is that I can't imagine why a package
so obviously useful as this hasn't been written before!!
;;; find-func
(find-function-setup-keys)

or just:

(load \"find-func\")

if you don't like the given keybindings and away you go!  It does
pretty much what you would expect, putting the cursor at the
definition of the function or variable at point.

The code started out from `describe-function', `describe-key'
(\"help.el\") and `fff-find-loaded-emacs-lisp-function' (Noah Friedman's
\"fff.el\").")

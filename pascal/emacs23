USAGE
=====

Emacs should enter Pascal mode when you find a Pascal source file.
When you have entered Pascal mode, you may get more info by pressing
C-h m. You may also get online help describing various functions by:
C-h f <Name of function you want described>

If you want to customize Pascal mode to fit you better, you may add
these lines (the values of the variables presented here are the defaults):

;; User customization for Pascal mode
(setq pascal-indent-level       3
      pascal-case-indent        2
      pascal-auto-newline       nil
      pascal-tab-always-indent  t
      pascal-auto-endcomments   t
      pascal-auto-lineup        '(all)
      pascal-toggle-completions nil
      pascal-type-keywords      '(\"array\" \"file\" \"packed\" \"char\"
				     \"integer\" \"real\" \"string\" \"record\")
      pascal-start-keywords     '(\"begin\" \"end\" \"function\" \"procedure\"
				     \"repeat\" \"until\" \"while\" \"read\" \"readln\"
				     \"reset\" \"rewrite\" \"write\" \"writeln\")
      pascal-separator-keywords '(\"downto\" \"else\" \"mod\" \"div\" \"then\"))

KNOWN BUGS / BUGREPORTS
=======================
As far as I know, there are no bugs in the current version of this
package.  This may not be true however, since I never use this mode
myself and therefore would never notice them anyway.   If you do
find any bugs, you may submit them to: esk@gnu.org as well as to
bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org.")

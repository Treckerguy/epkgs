Marking, and mapping commands over, multiple regions.

Available commands:
`multi-region-mark-region'     -- Mark the current region as a
                                  multi-region.
`multi-region-unmark-region'   -- Remove the current multi-region
                                  surrounding `point'.
`multi-region-unmark-regions'  -- Remove all multi-regions in the
                                  current buffer.
`multi-region-execute-command' -- Map a command over all active
                                  multi-regions in the current
                                  buffer.

A suggested keymap is available as `multi-region-map', to use
the keybindings, you could do something like:
(define-key global-map (kbd \"C-M-m\") multi-region-map)")

 :commentary "\
Allows you to colour and highlight arbitrary sections of buffers.

This can be useful when looking through complex code etc. Also the invisible pen
is useful for clearing away bits of information which are uninteresting.

Run 'M-x markerpen-show-all-pens' to get an idea of what effects you can get

The main interface is via the 'M-x markerpen-mark-region' - see documentation on that.
The markerpens are all implemented using overlays.

Let me know of any comments, suggestions, problems - but there are no
guarantees and use of this code is at your own risk.")

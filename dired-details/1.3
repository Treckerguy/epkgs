 -rw-r--r--   1 rgiardin svrtech       56 Aug 23 17:07 linked-file.el -> /var/tmp/checkouts/linked-file.el

look like this:

 /private/rgiardin/lispHome/emacs.config:
 used 1264 available files

 [...] ..
 [...] dired-details.el
 [...] my-really-really-long-I-mean-really-long-filename.el
 [...] linked-file.el -> [...]

The function `dired-details-toggle' will toggle details on and off.


INSTALLATION:

To apply `dired-details-hide' to all new dired buffers, add the
following to your .emacs:

(require 'dired-details)
(dired-details-install)

This also binds the following keys in dired buffers:

  ) - dired-details-show
  ( - dired-details-hide

CHANGES:

* 1.1: Setup hide and show keybindings earlier than the first hide.
* 1.1: add dired-details-initially-hide customization as suggested by Harold Maier
* 1.2: extensive change to support subdirs in dired buffers
* 1.2.1: respect current hidden state (not initial state) when inserting subdirs
* 1.3: dired-details-toggle and customization support added by Klaus Berndl

TODO:

* add a hook for dired-add-file to hide new entries as necessary

The `judge-indent-mode' distinguish, soon after finding file,
indent and tab widths into following 9 (strictly 7) patterns.
You can easily write your own code without breaking existing indent style.

      \\  indent
       \\  2 4 8
    tab \\------
      2 | U - -
      4 | X U -
      8 | X X U <- It cannot distinguish between `U's.
    nil | X X X")

 :commentary "\
The parts of dired mode not normally used.  This is a space-saving hack
to avoid having to load a large mode when all that's wanted are a few
functions.

Rewritten in 1990/1991 to add tree features, file marking and
sorting by Sebastian Kremer <sk@thp.uni-koeln.de>.
Finished up by rms in 1992.")

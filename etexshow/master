Etexshow is a clone of
texshow, a program shipped with the ConTeXt macro package (see
pragma-ade.com for a description of ConTeXt). It will serve as the base
of a context-mode for emacs. Please send bug reports and comments to me!
Thank you. See file todo for things that need to be done (that I know
of).

There is still an xml-file shipped with this code. Usually you would
generate the xml-file with 'texexec'ing the file setupe.tex. Then you
will get the cont-en.xml file that can (could) be used as an input for
this etexshow. But for now, this won't work. It will work rsn.

  Installation
================

please find installation instructions in the accompanied file README.txt


  Startup 
===========

To start etexshow, just
type 'M-x etexshow'

WARNING: The first start: etexshow reads an xml file and converts it
(pgxml.el) to a datastructure that will be stored in a cache file.
Please note that will take some time. 


  Configuration
=================

Etexshow works for me. Hopefully it will work for you as well. But
there are some points you have to look at. Etexshow will try to
find the xml files that is given in the alist
`etexshow-xml-files-alist'. Then it will write to a cache file
(which must not exist!) that are also given in this alist. Please
put a line in your .emacs where to find (store) these files:

(setq etexshow-xml-files-alist 
      '((\"~/etexshow/cont-en.xml\"    . \"~/etexshow/cont-en.cache\")
	   (\"~/etexshow/mycommands.xml\" . \"~/etexshow/mycommands.cache\")))

(the dots inbetween are needed). You have to give an even number of
files. The first file is the xml file, and the second file is the
cache file.")

 :commentary "\
Invoking the magit-status function will show a buffer with the
status of the current git repository and its working tree.  That
buffer offers key bindings for manipulating the status in simple
ways.

The status buffer mainly shows the difference between the working
tree and the index, and the difference between the index and the
current HEAD.  You can add individual hunks from the working tree
to the index, and you can commit the index.

See the Magit User Manual for more information.

TODO

For 0.8:

- Fix display of unmerged files.
- Fix performance problems with large status buffers.
- Handle the case where remote and local branches have different names.

Later:

- Queuing of asynchronous commands.
- Good email integration.
- Showing tags.
- Visiting from staged hunks doesn't always work since the line
  numbers don't refer to the working tree.  Fix that somehow.
- Figure out how to discard staged changes for files that also have
  unstaged changes.
- Get current defun from removed lines in a diff
- Amending commits other than HEAD.
- 'Subsetting', only looking at a subset of all files.")

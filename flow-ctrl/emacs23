 :commentary "\
Terminals that use XON/XOFF flow control can cause problems with
GNU Emacs users.  This file contains Emacs Lisp code that makes it
easy for a user to deal with this problem, when using such a
terminal.

To invoke these adjustments, a user need only invoke the function
enable-flow-control-on with a list of terminal types in his/her own
.emacs file.  As arguments, give it the names of one or more terminal
types in use by that user which require flow control adjustments.
Here's an example:

	(enable-flow-control-on \"vt200\" \"vt300\" \"vt101\" \"vt131\")

Portability note: This uses (getenv \"TERM\"), and therefore probably
won't work outside of UNIX-like environments.")

 :commentary "\
This module provides hashtable-like functions on top of imap.el
functionality.  All the authentication is handled by auth-source so
there are no authentication options here, only the server and
mailbox names are needed.

Create a IHT (imap-hash table) object with `imap-hash-make'.  Then
use it with `imap-hash-map' to map a function across all the
messages.  Use `imap-hash-get' and `imap-hash-rem' to operate on
individual messages.  See the tramp-imap.el library in Tramp if you
need to see practical examples.

This only works with IMAP4r1.  Sorry to everyone without it, but
the compatibility code is too annoying and it's 2009.

TODO: Use SEARCH instead of FETCH when a test is specified.  List
available mailboxes.  Don't select an invalid mailbox.")

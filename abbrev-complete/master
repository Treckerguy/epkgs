abbrev mode completion function

If you type M-x expand-abbrev in line head, abbreviations are listed to other window.

And you can operate like following expression. 

a M-x expand-abbrev
your addres M-x expand-abbrev (your addres = expansion of addres)
as far as I can tell M-x expand-abbrev (expansion of afaict)
abbrev  M-x expand-abbrev (expansion by dabbrev)
after  M-x expand-abbrev (expansion by dabbrev)")

 :commentary "\
This package provides improved describe-function and
describe-variable and combines major modes to edit programming
languages and their Info documentats closely.

`mode-info-describe-function' which is one of commands defined by
this package, is very similar to `describe-function', but can
select the appropriate document based on major-mode.  For example,
when it is called in c-mode buffers, it retrieves the documentation
of the specified function from GNU C Library Reference Manual and
shows it.  When it is called in emacs-lisp-mode buffers, it
retrieves the documentation from Emacs Lisp Reference Manual and
shows it.  If failure it shows a documentation string.

The latest version of this package can be downloaded from:

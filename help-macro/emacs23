This file supplies the macro make-help-screen which constructs
single character dispatching with browsable help such as that provided
by help-for-help. This can be used to make many modes easier to use; for
example, the GNU Emacs Empire Tool uses this for every \"nested\" mode map
called from the main mode map.

      The name of this package was changed from help-screen.el to
help-macro.el in order to fit in a 14-character limit.

->   From here, you can use the following options:
->
->c	Redistribute civs from overfull sectors into connected underfull ones
->	  The functions typically named by empire-ideal-civ-fcn control
->          based in part on empire-sector-civ-threshold
->m	Redistribute military using levels given by empire-ideal-mil-fcn
->p	Redistribute excess population to highways for max pop growth
->	  Excess is any sector so full babies will not be born.
->f	Even out food on highways to highway min and leave levels
->	  This is good to pump max food to all warehouses/dist pts

->Use \\\\[help-for-empire-redistribute-map] for help on redistribution.
->Use \\\\[help-for-empire-extract-map] for help on data extraction.

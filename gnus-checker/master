Set `gnus-checker-groups' to an alist of (group . face) pairs and
then you will get an indicator for those groups in their respective
faces.

for example:

(setq gnus-checker-groups
      '((\"nnmaildir:inbox\" . font-lock-warning-face)
        (\"nnmaildir:porn-casting\" . font-lock-too-small-face)))")

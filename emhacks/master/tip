 :commentary "\
This library is a sophisticated example of usage of the tree-widget
library.  It provides the `dir-tree' command which shows the
content of a directory in a tree widget.

A directory content is read when the corresponding tree node is
expanded for the first time.  To refresh the content of an expanded
directory, click on its name with the mouse-2 button.  Also, you
can change the sample select/unselect state of a file by clicking
on its name with the mouse-2 button.

To install and use, put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path and
add the following into your ~/.emacs start up file:

(require 'dir-tree)")

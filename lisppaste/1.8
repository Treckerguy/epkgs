 :commentary "\
This file provide an Emacs interface to the lisppaste bot running
on the Freenode IRC network (http://freenode.net).
A number of commands are provided.

Pasting a region may be carried out using `lisppaste-region'.
A top-level entry point to all of lisppaste's functionality is
provided via the `lisppaste' command.  If you want to intercept
lisppaste urls and display them in Emacs, you can do so by
modifying `browse-url-browser-function' as described in
`lisppaste-browse-url'.

Interacting with lisppaste requires xml-rpc.el which you can find
a link for at <URL: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/XmlRpc>.")

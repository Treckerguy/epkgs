garble.el is an emacs interface for garble, a command line tool for
talking to various Garmin <URL:http://www.garmin.com/> GPS units. See
<URL:http://freshmeat.net/projects/garble/?highlight=garble> for
information about garble.

This code aims to provide the primitive functions for talking to a Garmin
GPS unit and getting the data back in an Emacs Lisp friendly way. It
should be possible to write all sorts of things based around these
functions. For example, `sunrise-sunset' could be given a wrapper that
ensures you get the information for the location of your GPS unit:

(defun sunrise-sunset-here ()
  (interactive)
  (let* ((pos (garble-get-position))
         (calendar-location-name \"GPS location\")
         (calendar-longitude (car pos))
         (calendar-latitude (cadr pos)))
    (sunrise-sunset)))

 :commentary "\
This library provides an interface to the (old-style) last.fm
scrobbling interface.  It tries to do this in a pretty reliable
way, and retries the scrobbling if last.fm is down, which it pretty
often is.

Usage: Set `scrobble-user' and `scrobble-password', and then just call
(scrobble artist album track).")

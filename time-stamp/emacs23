A template in a file can be updated with a new time stamp when
you save the file.  For example:
    static char *ts = \"sdmain.c Time-stamp: <2001-08-13 10:20:51 gildea>\";
See the top of `time-stamp.el' for another example.

To use time-stamping, add this line to your .emacs file:
    (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'time-stamp)
Now any time-stamp templates in your files will be updated automatically.

See the documentation for the functions `time-stamp'
and `time-stamp-toggle-active' for details.")

This is Version 4.0 of the EDT Emulation for Emacs 19 and above.
It comes with special functions which replicate nearly all of EDT's
keypad mode behavior.  It sets up default keypad and function key
bindings which closely match those found in EDT.  Support is
provided so that users may reconfigure most keypad and function key
bindings to their own liking.

NOTE: Version 4.0 contains several enhancements.  See the
Enhancement section below for the details.

Getting Started:

To start the EDT Emulation, first start Emacs and then enter

   M-x edt-emulation-on

to begin the emulation.  After initialization is complete, the
following message will appear below the status line informing you
that the emulation has been enabled: \"Default EDT keymap active\".

You can have the EDT Emulation start up automatically, each time
you initiate a GNU Emacs session, by adding the following line to
your .emacs file:

   (add-hook term-setup-hook 'edt-emulation-on)

IMPORTANT: Be sure to read the Info node `edt' for more details.
It contains very helpful user information.

The EDT emulation consists of the following files:

edt.texi         - User manual
edt-user.el      - Sample Customization File
edt.el           - EDT Emulation Functions and Default Configuration
edt-lk201.el     - Built-in support for DEC LK-201 Keyboards
edt-vt100.el     - Built-in support for DEC VT-100 (and above) terminals
edt-pc.el        - Built-in support for PC 101 Keyboards under MS-DOS
edt-mapper.el    - Create an EDT LK-201 Map File for Keyboards Without
                     Built-in Support

Enhancements:

Version 4.0 contains the following enhancements:

 1.  Scroll margins at the top and bottom of the window are now
     supported.  (The design was copied from tpu-extras.el.)  By
     default, this feature is enabled, with the top margin set to
     10% of the window and the bottom margin set to 15% of the
     window.  To change these settings, you can invoke the function
     edt-set-scroll-margins in your .emacs file.  For example, the
     following line

          (edt-set-scroll-margins \"20%\" \"25%\")

     sets the top margin to 20% of the window and the bottom margin
     to 25% of the window.  To disable this feature, set each
     margin to 0%.  You can also invoke edt-set-scroll-margins
     interactively while EDT Emulation is active to change the
     settings for that session.

     NOTE: Another way to set the scroll margins is to use the
     Emacs customization feature (not available in Emacs 19) to set
     the following two variables directly:

          edt-top-scroll-margin and edt-bottom-scroll-margin

     Enter the Emacs `customize' command.  First select the Editing
     group and then select the Emulations group.  Finally, select
     the Edt group and follow the directions.

 2.  The SUBS command is now supported and bound to GOLD-Enter by
     default.  (This design was copied from tpu-edt.el.)  Note, in
     earlier versions of EDT Emulation, GOLD-Enter was assigned to
     the Emacs function `query-replace'.  The binding of
     `query-replace' has been moved to GOLD-/.  If you prefer to
     restore `query-replace' to GOLD-Enter, then use an EDT user
     customization file, edt-user.el, to do this.
     See Info node `edt' for more details.

 3.  EDT Emulation now also works in XEmacs, including the
     highlighting of selected text.

 4.  If you access a workstation using an X Server, observe that
     the initialization file generated by edt-mapper.el will now
     contain the name of the X Server vendor.  This is a
     convenience for those who have access to their Unix account
     from more than one type of X Server.  Since different X
     Servers typically require different EDT emulation
     initialization files, edt-mapper.el will now generate these
     different initialization files and save them with different
     names.  Then, the correct initialization file for the
     particular X server in use is loaded correctly automatically.

 5.  Also, edt-mapper.el is now capable of binding an ASCII key
     sequence, providing the ASCII key sequence prefix is already
     known by Emacs to be a prefix.  As a result of providing this
     support, some terminal/keyboard/window system configurations,
     which don't have a complete set of sensible function key
     bindings built into Emacs in `function-key-map', can still be
     configured for use with EDT Emulation.  (Note: In a few rare
     circumstances this does not work properly.  In particular, it
     does not work if a subset of the leading ASCII characters in a
     key sequence are recognized by Emacs as having an existing
     binding.  For example, if the keypad 7 (KP-7) key generates
     the sequence \\\"<ESC>Ow\\\" and \\\"<ESC>O\\\" is already bound to a
     function, pressing KP-7 when told to do so by edt-mapper.el
     will result in edt-mapper.el incorrectly mapping \\\"<ESC>O\\\" to
     KP-7 and \\\"w\\\" to KP-8.  If something like this happens to
     you, it is probably a bug in the support for your keyboard
     within Emacs OR a bug in the Unix termcap/terminfo support for
     your terminal OR a bug in the terminal emulation software you
     are using.)

 6.  The edt-quit function (bound to GOLD-q by default) has been
     modified to warn the user when file-related buffer
     modifications exist.  It now cautions the user that those
     modifications will be lost if the user quits without saving
     those buffers.")

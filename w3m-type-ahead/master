Type ahead support for Emacs-w3m.  This allows an isearch facility
that is limited to HREF anchors.  Switch the mode on for all
w3m-mode buffers with:

    (autoload 'w3m-type-ahead-mode \"w3m-type-ahead\" \"Type ahead support for Emacs-w3m.\" t)
    (add-hook 'w3m-mode-hook 'w3m-type-ahead-mode)")

Automatically save place in files, so that visiting them later
(even during a different Emacs session) automatically moves point
to the saved position, when the file is first found.  Uses the
value of buffer-local variable save-place to determine whether to
save position or not.

Thanks to Stefan Schoef, who sent a patch with the
`save-place-version-control' stuff in it.")

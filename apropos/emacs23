 :commentary "\
The ideas for this package were derived from the C code in
src/keymap.c and elsewhere.  The functions in this file should
always be byte-compiled for speed.  Someone should rewrite this in
C (as part of src/keymap.c) for speed.

The idea for super-apropos is based on the original implementation
by Lynn Slater <lrs@esl.com>.

History:
Fixed bug, current-local-map can return nil.
Change, doesn't calculate key-bindings unless needed.
Added super-apropos capability, changed print functions.
Made fast-apropos and super-apropos share code.
Sped up fast-apropos again.
Added apropos-do-all option.
Added fast-command-apropos.
Changed doc strings to comments for helping functions.
Made doc file buffer read-only, buried it.
Only call substitute-command-keys if do-all set.

Optionally use configurable faces to make the output more legible.
Differentiate between command, function and macro.
Apropos-command (ex command-apropos) does cmd and optionally user var.
Apropos shows all 3 aspects of symbols (fn, var and plist)
Apropos-documentation (ex super-apropos) now finds all it should.
New apropos-value snoops through all values and optionally plists.
Reading DOC file doesn't load nroff.
Added hypertext following of documentation, mouse-2 on variable gives value
  from buffer in active window.")

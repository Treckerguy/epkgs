This package is for running a remote compilation and using emacs to parse
the error messages. It works by rsh'ing the compilation to a remote host
and parsing the output. If the file visited at the time remote-compile was
called was loaded remotely (ange-ftp), the host and user name are obtained
by the calling ange-ftp-ftp-name on the current directory. In this case the
next-error command will also ange-ftp the files over. This is achieved
automatically because the compilation-parse-errors function uses
default-directory to build its file names. If however the file visited was
loaded locally, remote-compile prompts for a host and user and assumes the
files mounted locally (otherwise, how was the visited file loaded).

See the user defined variables section for more info.

I was contemplating redefining \"compile\" to \"remote-compile\" automatically
if the file visited was ange-ftp'ed but decided against it for now. If you
feel this is a good idea, let me know and I'll consider it again.

Installation:

To use rcompile, you also need to give yourself permission to connect to
the remote host.  You do this by putting lines like:

monopoly alon
vme33

in a file named .rhosts in the home directory (of the remote machine).
Be careful what you put in this file. A line like:

+

Will allow anyone access to your account without a password. I suggest you
read the rhosts(5) manual page before you edit this file (if you are not
familiar with it already)")

 :commentary "\
This code represents a replaceable backend layer for the emacs wave
mode.  It is responsible for communicating with the Wave server.

This backend uses a direct connection to https://wave.google.com.

WARNING: This code utilizes the unpublished client/server protocol
that wave.google.com's javascript uses to communicate with the wave
servers. This is not a stable protocol supported by Google. This
protocol is the Google Wave team's internal protocol and is under
active development, so it may change at any time without regards
for this or any other client.")

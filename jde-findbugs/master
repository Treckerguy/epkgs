This package provides an interface from JDE (see
http://jde.sunsite.dk/) to Findbugs (see
http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/), a development tool that looks
for bugs in Java code.


Currently it has the following limitations: 

 You cannot yet run the check on a single class, only either the
 current package, or a directory defined in a variable.  Just have
 to identify the name(s) of the classes to pass to findbugs.
 Should be easy.

 You cannot yet specify memory parameters to the JVM.  Should be
 easy.

 findbugs sometimes outputs extra information to stderr that can
 trick the compile window into thinking there is an error to jump
 to.  I'm not sure what to do about this.

 Not all of the error messages output by findbugs in it's \"emacs\"
 format are actually in the right format (e.g.: UrF). I have
 submitted a patch to findbugs that helps somewhat at
 http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1117624&group_id=96405&atid=614695


Installation:

 Put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path and add following into your
 ~/.emacs startup file

     (require 'jde-findbugs)")

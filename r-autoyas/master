Changes by Matthew Fidler

The snippet expansion occurs with the normal tab key.

Attempted to support nested autosnippets;  I'm not sure it works yet.

Usage:
* Start yas/minor-mode

* To expand a snippet write the function name and press <TAB>

* The value is highlighted.  If you wish to delete the argument,
  press C-d and the value will disappear

* Alternatively you may press <TAB> to keep the default value.
  Currently it will be removed unless yasnippet cannot tell if it
  is modified.

* To exit a snippet and delete remaining arguments, press C-g.

Limitations

* No nice error handling (e.g. when no R process is found).

* No nested autosnippets supported. I think it should be possible
  to support them, but it turned out that my knowledge of lisp and
  of yasnippet's snippet organisation is far too limited. I guess
  the use of yas/exit-all-snippets would have to be replaced by
  exiting just the \"inner\" snippets. Can anyone help?")

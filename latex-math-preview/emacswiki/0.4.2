 :commentary "\
latex-math-preview.el has the following three main commands.

M-x `latex-math-preview-expression' previews mathematical expressions pointed
by cursor in LaTeX files or strings of selected region with transient-mark on.
The result of this command is shown as image in new buffer.

M-x `latex-math-preview-insert-symbol' displays the list of LaTeX symbols.
Selecting a LaTeX symbol from it, you can insert it.
Depending on whether cursor is in mathematical expression or not,
this commands choose the symbol list.
If you don't want to use the automatic selection,
alternatively you may use M-x `latex-math-preview-insert-mathematical-symbol'
and M-x `latex-math-preview-insert-text-symbol' for mathematical symbol
and normal text symbol, respectively.

M-x `latex-math-preview-save-image-file' make an image for the same object
as `latex-math-preview-expression' and save it as a file which is png or eps.
When making an image, this command may remove number of mathematical formulas.

Buffer local variable `latex-math-preview-usepackage-cache' has
the values of \\usepackage for previewing.
If you want to reload this variable, you use
M-x `latex-math-preview-reload-usepackage'.

Requirements;
You need to install the following softwares.

 - Emacs (version 22 or 23) on Linux or Meadow3 on Windows.
 - dvipng
 - dvips
 - latex (or platex)

latex and dvipng is used for making preview image.
dvips is for making eps image and not for previewing.")

latex-math-preview creates images of particular region in LaTeX file
and display them in emacs.
latex-math-preview has the following main commands.

M-x `latex-math-preview-expression' previews mathematical expressions pointed
by cursor in LaTeX files or strings of selected region with transient-mark on.
The result of this command is shown as image in new buffer.

M-x `latex-math-preview-insert-symbol' displays the list of LaTeX symbols.
Selecting a LaTeX symbol from it, you can insert it.
Depending on whether cursor is in mathematical expression or not,
this commands choose the symbol list.
If you don't want to use the automatic mode selection,
alternatively you may use M-x `latex-math-preview-insert-mathematical-symbol'
and M-x `latex-math-preview-insert-text-symbol' for mathematical symbol
and normal text symbol, respectively.

M-x `latex-math-preview-save-image-file' makes an image for the same object
as `latex-math-preview-expression' and save it as a file which is png or eps.
When making an image, this command may remove number of mathematical formulas.

Buffer local variable `latex-math-preview-usepackage-cache' has
the values of \\usepackage for previewing.
If you want to reload this variable, you use
M-x `latex-math-preview-reload-usepackage'.

M-x `latex-math-preview-beamer-frame' makes an image of one frame of beamer,
which is LaTeX style for presentation.
This feature is experimental for now and it is possible not to work on your environment.

Requirements;
Because latex-math-preview displays images in emacs,
it is not work in emacs on terminal.

* Version of Emacs *
The version of emacs is 22 or 23 on Linux.
latex-math-preview is tested on Ubuntu 10.04.
But on Meadow 3 on Windows latex-math-preview probably works.

* Image Conversion *
latex-math-preview uses some commands to convert tex to png, tex to eps, and so on.
Only for previewing mathematical expressions, latex-math-preview requires
latex and dvipng commands.
According to your environment and settings of latex-math-preview,
latex-math-preview creates preview images by combining the following commands.

 - dvipng
 - dvips
 - latex
 - platex
 - pdflatex
 - dvipdf
 - dvipdfm
 - dvipdfmx
 - gs

Install of Emacs Lisp:
* Load latex-math-preview *
Put latex-math-preview.el to your load-path of Emacs and
write the following code in ~/.emacs.el.

  (autoload 'latex-math-preview-expression \"latex-math-preview\" nil t)
  (autoload 'latex-math-preview-insert-symbol \"latex-math-preview\" nil t)
  (autoload 'latex-math-preview-save-image-file \"latex-math-preview\" nil t)
  (autoload 'latex-math-preview-beamer-frame \"latex-math-preview\" nil t)

* Key Bindings *
Please set key bindings of TeX mode which you prefer if desired.

For example, for YaTeX mode we add the following settings to ~/.emacs.el.

  (add-hook 'yatex-mode-hook
           '(lambda ()
           (YaTeX-define-key \"p\" 'latex-math-preview-expression)
           (YaTeX-define-key \"\\C-p\" 'latex-math-preview-save-image-file)
           (YaTeX-define-key \"j\" 'latex-math-preview-insert-symbol)
           (YaTeX-define-key \"\\C-j\" 'latex-math-preview-last-symbol-again)
           (YaTeX-define-key \"\\C-b\" 'latex-math-preview-beamer-frame)))
  (setq latex-math-preview-in-math-mode-p-func 'YaTeX-in-math-mode-p)

In particular case latex-math-preview-in-math-mode-p does not work well.
So you may use YaTeX-in-math-mode-p alternatively.

This setting almost binds latex-math-preview-expression to \"C-c p\",
latex-math-preview-save-image-file to \"C-c C-p\",
latex-math-preview-insert-symbol to \"C-c j\",
latex-math-preview-last-symbol-again to \"C-c C-j\",
and latex-math-preview-beamer-frame to \"C-c C-b\".

* Path of Programs *
latex-math-preview.el uses 'latex', 'dvipng' and 'dvips'.
If the programs (dvipng, dvips, latex, and so on) 
are not in the load path of system or
you want to use the different programs from the default,
you need to change the variable `latex-math-preview-command-path-alist'.
For example,
   (setq latex-math-preview-command-path-alist
         '((latex . \"/usr/bin/latex\") (dvipng . \"/usr/bin/dvipng\") (dvips . \"/usr/bin/dvips\")))")

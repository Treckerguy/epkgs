Enhancements of standard library `ls-lisp.el'.

 If you use MS Windows, MS-DOS, or MacOS, then you will likely want
 to use library `ls-lisp.el' plus this library, to use an Emacs
 Lisp only definition of `insert-directory'.

 `ls-lisp+.el' loads libraries `ls-lisp.el' and `files+.el'.  Both
 `files+.el' and `ls-lisp+.el' redefine `insert-directory' so that
 the second header line includes the number of files and
 directories in the directory.  Files `.' and `..' are excluded
 from the count, but all other directories listed are included.

 The second header line thus becomes this, in Emacs 22:

   files 276 space used  27359 available 56238272

 or this, in Emacs 20 and 21:

   files 276 total 27359

 This library also provides a fix for bug #2801 for Emacs 21 and 22
 for the case where switches `F' and `R' are both provided.  This
 is fixed in vanilla Emacs 23.")

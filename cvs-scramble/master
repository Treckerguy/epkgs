 :commentary "\
Implements the (trivial) scramble/descrambling methods for CVS pserver
passwords.  Method A, the only implemented method as of 1998-07-30, is a
trivial substitution cipher.

\"This is really cute, especially considering that the original
scrambling table was set up by an one-time elisp function.\"

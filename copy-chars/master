 :commentary "\
This package adds support for copying data from a buffer to
another a few characters at a time. It is meant mostly as an
amusement to impress your friends with (\"wow, do you really type
that fast?\").

To use it, load this package and:
1. Visit a buffer with some data that you want to copy.
   Go to the start of your data and execute the command
   M-x copychars-start-copy-at-point.
2. Go somewhere where you want to copy data (e.g., create an empty
   file). Run M-x copychars-mode, and start pressing the function
   keys f5, f6, f7 and f8, with or without Shift. Repeatedly pressing
   f5 to f8 looks kind of like you're typing the characters yourself.

See the description for `copychars-mode' for more information.

You may want to set `copychars-default-regexp' to the value in its
description, to make the keys always jump over whitespace.")

 :commentary "\
This module provides an Emacs interface to RFC2324-compliant coffee
devices (Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol, or HTCPCP). It
prompts the user for the different additives, then issues a BREW
request to the coffee device.

coffee.el requires a special BREW-capable version of Emacs/W3 to be
installed.

and the addition of the \"Brown-Coffee\" sweetener type.")

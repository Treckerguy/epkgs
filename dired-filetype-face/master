Set faces for different file type in dired buffer. I use a dark
 background, so maybe the default face doesn't meet your request.
 you can : M-x: customize-group dired-filetype-face  RET
 And maybe M-x: customize-group dired-faces  RET
 may do some help for you.


Installation:

Just put `dired-filetype-face.el' to your load-path.
The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name \"~/elisp\"))

Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.

(eval-after-load 'dired '(progn (require 'dired-filetype-face)))

No need more.")

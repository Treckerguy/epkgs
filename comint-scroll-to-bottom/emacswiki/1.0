This will cause comint buffers to always display the maximum amount
of output by keeping the prompt at the bottom of the respective
window. The code is taken from ERC, and adapted to comint-mode.

To use, just add the following to your .emacs:

(add-hook 'comint-mode-hook 'comint-add-scroll-to-bottom)")

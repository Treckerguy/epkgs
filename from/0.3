This package lets you quickly see subjects and senders of messages in
your mailspools, without the overhead of starting up a mailreader.

To install, drop it in a directory on your `load-path', and add
the following to your .emacs:

	(autoload 'from \"from\" \"Show who messages in mailspools is from.\" t)

Then customize the variable `from-mailspools' to point to the spools
you're interested in.")

This file provides support for hiding and unhiding HTML elements.

Acknowledgements:

html-fold is depeloped based on tex-fold.el in AUCTeX, written by 
Ralf Angeli <angeli@iwi.uni-sb.de>.

Caveats:

The display string of content which should display part of itself
is made by copying the text from the buffer together with its text
properties.  If fontification has not happened when this is done
(e.g. because of lazy or just-in-time font locking) the intended
fontification will not show up.  Maybe this could be improved by
using some sort of \"lazy folding\" or refreshing the window upon
scrolling.  As a workaround fontification of the whole buffer
currently is forced before folding it.")

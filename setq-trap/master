 :commentary "\
For this to work, all the code in which you want to debug setq calls
must not be byte-compiled.  Even if you modified the byte-compiler not
to generate code using the setq bytecode, any previously compiled code
would still use the setq bytecode and bypass any redefinition in lisp.
Anyway, isn't debugging byte-compiled code inherently more difficult?")

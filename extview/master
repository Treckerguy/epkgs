Load the library and try opening a file which has an associated
application in `extview-application-associations' or in mailcap.

`extview-application-associations' can be used to override mailcap
handlers:

  (require 'extview)
  (push '(\"\\\\.pdf$\" . \"acroread %s\") extview-application-associations)
  (push '(\"\\\\.py$\" . nil) extview-application-associations)
  (push '(\"\\\\.html$\" . ask) extview-application-associations)")

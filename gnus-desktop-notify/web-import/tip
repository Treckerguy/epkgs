Desktop notification integration in Gnus!? Ohh goody!

gnus-desktop-notify.el provides a simple mechanism to notify external
programs when new messages are received. For basic usage, to be used in
conjunction with gnus-daemon, put the following:

(require 'gnus-desktop-notify)
(gnus-desktop-notify-mode)
(gnus-demon-add-scanmail)

into your .gnus file. You'll need the 'notify-send' program, which (in
Debian) is available in the 'libnotify-bin' package. Each time a group
receives new mail, the 'notify-send' program is called, creating a small
popup message containing the name of the group and the number of new
messages.

By default, all groups are notified when new messages are received. You can
exclude a single group by setting the `group-notify' group parameter to
t. You can also selectively monitor groups instead by changing the
`gnus-desktop-notify-groups' variable to `gnus-desktop-notify-explicit' and
then manually selecting which groups to include. Press 'G c' in the group
buffer to customize group parameters interactively.

You can actually call any program by changing the
`gnus-desktop-notify-exec-program' variable, or change the behavior entirely
by setting a different `gnus-desktop-notify-function' function, or change
the way the popup is generated with `gnus-desktop-notify-send-mode'.

See the `gnus-desktop-notify' customization group for more details.

According to the layout diagrams available from the OLPC project,
and others, the Mongolian Cyrillic keyboard layout is quite, but
not completely, different from the Russian one.

Because my keyboard (US-style) doesn't have a printing character
key to the right of \"=+\", I've transferred that letter to \"`~\"
(i.e. the other end of the same row).  I'd welcome comment and
corrections from a regular Mongolian computer user.

Note:

I wrote this at an early stage of learning Mongolian, so that I
could use it for making grammar notes, etc.  It should be checked
by someone who is accustomed to typing in Mongolian!")

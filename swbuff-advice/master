 :commentary "\
The swbuff package provides a way to cycle thru the buffers,
 optionally filtering out certain buffers via a regexp.  The
 swbuff-advice package provides advice for several 'swbuff'
 functions to allow the use of more than one set of regexp filters.

 It also provides a way to define inclusive (rather then exclusive)
 filters, and additive-exclusive filters.  Normally, a buffer is
 included in the list of buffers to switch to if it does not match
 at least one of the normal filters.  With inclusive filters, the
 buffer name must also match EVERY inclusive filter regexp.  with
 additive-exclusive filters, the buffer name must not match ANY of
 the additive filters.  See `joc-swbuff-allow-inclusive-regexps'
 and `joc-swbuff-allow-additive-regexps' for more details.

 For use with swbuff versions 2.1 or later

Installation:

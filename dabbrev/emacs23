The purpose with this package is to let you write just a few
characters of words you've written earlier to be able to expand
them.

To expand a word, just put the point right after the word and press
M-/ (dabbrev-expand) or M-C-/ (dabbrev-completion).

Check out the customizable variables below to learn about all the
features of this package.

Hints and tips for major modes writers:

Recommended values		C/Lisp etc	text
dabbrev-case-fold-search	nil		t
dabbrev-case-replace		nil		t

Set the variables you want special for your mode like this:
(set (make-local-variable 'dabbrev-case-replace) nil)
Then you don't interfere with other modes.

If your mode handles buffers that refers to other buffers
(i.e. compilation-mode, gud-mode), then try to set
`dabbrev-select-buffers-function' or `dabbrev-friend-buffer-function'
to a function that point out those buffers.

Same goes for major-modes that are connected to other modes.  There
are for instance a number of mail-modes.  One for reading, one for
creating a new mail etc.  Maybe those should be connected.

Example for GNUS (when we write a reply, we want dabbrev to look in
the article for expansion):
(set (make-local-variable 'dabbrev-friend-buffer-function)
     (lambda (buffer)
        (with-current-buffer buffer
          (memq major-mode '(news-reply-mode gnus-article-mode)))))


Known bugs and limitations.
- Possible to do several levels of `dabbrev-completion' in the
  minibuffer.
- dabbrev-completion doesn't handle resetting the globals variables
  right.  It resets them after finding the abbrev.

Future enhancements
 - Check the tags-files? Like tags-complete?
 - Add the possibility of searching both forward and backward to
   the nearest expansion.
 - Check the kill-ring when everything else fails.  (Maybe something
 for hippie-expand?).  [Bng] <boris@cs.rochester.edu>

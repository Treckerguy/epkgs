Usage: Open any vhdl file and invoke vhdl-goto-type-def with key sequence (\\C-c\\C-s by default).
Cursor will jump to corresponding definition if there is one. Functions searches packages
too. If no buffer with package is open, functions asks for location of package.

To get back to the start of the search, press \\C-x\\C-x if corresponding definition has been found
in the same file, \\C-x b RET if the search has jumped to another buffer.

Functions works for signals, constants, types, subtypes, components and subprograms.
Works only well for vhdl files with more or less correct syntax. Finds also signals in entity definition.

Also have a look at customization possibilities with \\M-x customize-group whdl. Change option
use-ido-find-file to nil if ido-find-file is not installed on your system.

If you have any suggestions or found any bugs please mail me at <wandad.guscheh@fh-hagenberg.at>.")

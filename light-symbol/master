 :commentary "\
This defines a new minor mode which highlights the symbol under
point in the current buffer.  You must pause briefly in order to
see the effect.  The highlight is removed when you take any action.

ToDo:

- should use defcustom
- don't do anything when in string syntax - ?
  also perhaps not in comment syntax?")

Rinari Is Not A Ruby IDE.

Well, ok it kind of is. Rinari is a set of Emacs Lisp modes that is
aimed towards making Emacs into a top-notch Ruby and Rails
development environment.

Copy the directory containing this file into your Emacs lisp
directory, assumed here to be ~/.emacs.d. Add these lines of code
to your .emacs file:

;; ido
(require 'ido)
(ido-mode t)
;; rinari
(add-to-list 'load-path \"~/.emacs.d/rinari\")
(require 'rinari)

Note: if you cloned this from a git repo, you probably have to grab
the submodules which can be done simply with the following commands
from the root of the rinari directory

 git submodule init
 git submodule update

See TODO file in this directory.")

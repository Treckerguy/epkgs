 :commentary "\
If you give M-x fshell a prefix arg after loading this, it will create a
new shell buffer even if one already exists.  If you give it an explicit
numeric prefix arg, it will try to switch to that numbered shell buffer,
or create it.

The alternative is to rename the current shell buffer and invoke M-x
shell, which is more keystrokes, especially if you decide to name your
old shell back when you're done with the newer one.

rms declined to add this functionality in emacs' shell.el, so I'm
maintaining it separately.")

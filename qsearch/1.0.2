After loading, type a string while pressing Super to search forward,
type any string while pressing Hyper to search backwards.  Thus, you
can skipt to the end of the sentence using s-. or to the end of the
line using s-<return> or to the end of the paragraph using s-<return>
s-<return>.  This saves you the C-s keystroke used for isearch.  At
the same time, qsearch is quite crude -- no overlays, no repeating of
searches, no support for environments without Super and Hyper keys,
no support for regexps, no customizations.

Note that you might need to setup Super and Hyper using xmodmap.
Example code for your .xmodmaprc or .Xmodmap file:

keycode 115 = Hyper_L
keycode 116 = Super_R
clear mod3
clear mod4
clear mod5
add mod3 = Hyper_L
add mod4 = Super_R")

Don't zone out in front of Emacs!  Try M-x zone.
If it eventually irritates you, try M-x zone-leave-me-alone.

Bored by the zone pyrotechnics?  Write your own!  Add it to
`zone-programs'.  See `zone-call' for higher-ordered zoning.

WARNING: Not appropriate for Emacs sessions over modems or
         computers as slow as mine.

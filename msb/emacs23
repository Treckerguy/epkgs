Purpose of this package:
  1. Offer a function for letting the user choose buffer,
     not necessarily for switching to it.
  2. Make a better mouse-buffer-menu.  This is done as a global
     minor mode, msb-mode.

Customization:
  Look at the variable `msb-menu-cond' for deciding what menus you
  want.  It's not that hard to customize, despite my not-so-good
  doc-string.  Feel free to send me a better doc-string.
  There are some constants for you to try here:
  msb--few-menus
  msb--very-many-menus (default)

  Look at the variable `msb-item-handling-function' for customization
  of the appearance of every menu item.  Try for instance setting
  it to `msb-alon-item-handler'.

  Look at the variable `msb-item-sort-function' for customization
  of sorting the menus.  Set it to t for instance, which means no
  sorting - you will get latest used buffer first.

  Also check out the variable `msb-display-invisible-buffers-p'.

Known bugs:
- Files-by-directory
  + No possibility to show client/changed buffers separately.
  + All file buffers only appear in a file sub-menu, they will
    for instance not appear in the Mail sub-menu.

Future enhancements:

hacked on by Dave Love.")

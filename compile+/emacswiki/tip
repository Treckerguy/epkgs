Extensions to `compile.el'.

 See also the companion file `compile-.el'.
       `compile-.el' should be loaded before `compile.el'.
       `compile+.el' should be loaded after `compile.el'.

 Put this in your initialization file (`~/.emacs'):

   (require 'compile+)

 Additional keys are bound here.  Some bindings that would normally
 try to modify a compilation mode buffer are unbound, so they are
 available for local (Compilation Mode) definition.

This package aimed to provide one or more functions to get
informations about the position on the screen of a visible point.
With this information someone can create a frame near the point and
provide a completion UI for example.

Why make a package for such a small thing ?
Because I saw more than one Emacs package doing that thing and I
needed it too. I prefer to do that in a separate file because:
- it can be used by one or more package
- it can be enhanced to handle different window systems more
  accurately

Note: At the moment of this writing the code is shamelessly stolen
from the esense package.

Here is a list of packages that implements similar routines inside
their code.
- http://esense.sourceforge.net
- http://www.emacswiki.org/PosTip
- http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/tooltip-help.el
- http://code.google.com/p/csense/source/browse/trunk/csense.el
- `dframe-reposition-frame-emacs' in dframe.el (shipped with Emacs)")

 :commentary "\
This is a spot of code to get an Emacs coding system from the \"=encoding\"
line in perl pod documentation, either inline in perl code, or a separate
pod file.

Emacs can often recognise unicode by itself, it can definitely recognise
the unicode byte order markers (utf-16 or utf-8) which pod files can use,
but other coding systems need some help.")

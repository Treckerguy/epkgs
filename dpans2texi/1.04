This program converts the TeX sources for the draft proposed ANSI
Common Lisp standard to Texinfo.  The TeX sources are available
from ftp://parcftp.xerox.com/pub/cl/dpANS3 and
ftp://parcftp.xerox.com/pub/cl/dpANS3R

It's by no means a general TeX to Texinfo converter -- the
conversion is only doable because most of the draft is written with
a set of mostly semantic macros.  In the cases where the draft
reverts to basic TeX, we mostly bail out, see `dp-special-cases'.

The simpler TeX macros are implemented as Texinfo macros in
`dp.texi' (`dpi.texi' and `dph.texi' contain macros that should be
done differently for Info and HTML).

`makeinfo' isn't multibyte clean, so we have to map multibyte chars
to unused 8bit chars, and post-process the Info files with `dp-tr'.
This isn't necessary for HTML.

To use `C-h C-i' (`info-lookup-symbol') to look up the symbol at
point in the manual, add the following to your .emacs:

(require 'info-look)

(info-lookup-add-help
 :mode 'lisp-mode
 :regexp \"[^][()'\\\" \\t\\n]+\"
 :ignore-case t
 :doc-spec '((\"(ansicl)Symbol Index\" nil nil nil)))")

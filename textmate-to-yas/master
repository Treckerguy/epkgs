 :commentary "\
This library allows you to import TextMate bundle snippets to
 Yasnippet

 To use, put in a directory in the load path, like ~/elisp and put
 the following in ~/.emacs

 (require 'textmate-to-yas)

 If you wish to use a snippet from GitHub, just drag the .tar.gz
 file to emacs while Yasnippet is running")

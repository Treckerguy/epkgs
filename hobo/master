Hobo facilitates editing remote files by automating file transfers
 via SCP, relying on SSH-AGENT (or RSA/DSA) to authenticate.  Hobo
 stores files locally in a temporary directory structure and can
 automatically clean up the temporary files and directories when
 you're done.  In addition, it makes accessing the remote files a
 tad easier using aliases/shortcuts with all of the connection info
 already set up.  See 'Existential Background' below for
 information on alternatives to Hobo.

Installation:

 Put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path, then add one of the
 following to your ~/.emacs startup file.  You can load hobo
 every time you start Emacs:

    (require 'hobo)

 or you can load the package on first use via autoload:

    (autoload 'hobo-register-agent \"hobo\" \"\" t)
    (autoload 'hobo-register-agent-from-file \"hobo\" \"\" t)
    (autoload 'hobo-find-file \"hobo\" \"\" t)

 To add a directory to your load-path, use something like the following:

     (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name \"/some/load/path\"))")

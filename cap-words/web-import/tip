Provides Capitalized Words minor mode for word movement -- in fact
a general definition of words -- in identifiers
CapitalizedLikeThis.  [Terms for this include `medial case',
`CamelCase', `CapitalizedWords', `CapWords', `mixed case' (leading
lower case), `InterCaps', `compoundNames'.  See the Wikipedia entry
for CamelCase, which looks reasonably believable.]  In common with,
for instance, http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/, we'll
consider all-caps sequences to be words unless the last character
starts a capitalized word, e.g. `HTTPError' comprises `HTTP' and
`Error'.

You might expect to do this sort of thing by adjusting the local
category table and `word-separating-categories' so that upper case
characters produce word boundaries, but the necessary processing
isn't done for ASCII characters (see the end of category.h).

Fixme: This doesn't work properly for mouse double clicks --
e.g. clicking on an initial capital includes the capitalized words
before and after it, which looks like a bug in mouse.el.")

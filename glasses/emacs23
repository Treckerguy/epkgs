This file defines a minor mode for making unreadableIdentifiersLikeThis
readable.  In some environments, for instance Java, it is common to use such
unreadable identifiers.  It is not good to use underscores in identifiers of
your own project in such an environment to make your sources more readable,
since it introduces undesirable confusion, which is worse than the
unreadability.  Fortunately, you use Emacs for the subproject, so the
problem can be solved some way.

This file defines the `glasses-mode' minor mode, which displays underscores
between all the pairs of lower and upper English letters.  (This only
displays underscores, the text is not changed actually.)  Alternatively, you
can say you want the capitals in some given face (e.g. bold).

The mode does something usable, though not perfect.  Improvement suggestions
from Emacs experts are welcome.

If you like in-identifier separators different from underscores, change the
value of the variable `glasses-separator' appropriately.  See also the
variables `glasses-face' and `glasses-convert-on-write-p'.  You can also use
the command `M-x customize-group RET glasses RET'.

If you set any of the variables `glasses-separator' or `glasses-face' after
glasses.el is loaded in a different way than through customize, you
should call the function `glasses-set-overlay-properties' afterwards.")

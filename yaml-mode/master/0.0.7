 :commentary "\
This is a major mode for editing files in the YAML data
serialization format.  It was initially developed by Yoshiki
Kurihara and many features were added by Marshall Vandegrift.  As
YAML and Python share the fact that indentation determines
structure, this mode provides indentation and indentation command
behavior very similar to that of python-mode.

Installation:

To install, just drop this file into a directory in your
`load-path' and (optionally) byte-compile it.  To automatically
handle files ending in '.yml', add something like:

   (require 'yaml-mode)
   (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.yml$\" . yaml-mode))

to your .emacs file.

Unlike python-mode, this mode follows the Emacs convention of not
binding the ENTER key to `newline-and-indent'.  To get this
behavior, add the key definition to `yaml-mode-hook':

   (add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook
    '(lambda ()
       (define-key yaml-mode-map \"\\C-m\" 'newline-and-indent)))")

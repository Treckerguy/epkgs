 :commentary "\
This package provides an Emacs major mode for editing VHDL code.
It includes the following features:

  - Syntax highlighting
  - Indentation
  - Template insertion (electrification)
  - Insertion of file headers
  - Insertion of user-specified models
  - Port translation / testbench generation
  - Structural composition
  - Configuration generation
  - Sensitivity list updating
  - File browser
  - Design hierarchy browser
  - Source file compilation (syntax analysis)
  - Makefile generation
  - Code hiding
  - Word/keyword completion
  - Block commenting
  - Code fixing/alignment/beautification
  - Postscript printing
  - VHDL'87/'93/'02 and VHDL-AMS supported
  - Comprehensive menu
  - Fully customizable
  - Works under GNU Emacs (recommended) and XEmacs


Documentation

See comment string of function `vhdl-mode' or type `C-c C-h' in Emacs.


Emacs Versions

supported: GNU Emacs 20.X/21.X/22.X,23.X, XEmacs 20.X/21.X
tested on: GNU Emacs 20.4/21.3/22.1,23.X, XEmacs 21.1 (marginally)


Installation

Prerequisites:  GNU Emacs 20.X/21.X/22.X/23.X, XEmacs 20.X/21.X.

Put `vhdl-mode.el' into the `site-lisp' directory of your Emacs installation
or into an arbitrary directory that is added to the load path by the
following line in your Emacs start-up file `.emacs':

  (setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name \"<directory-name>\") load-path))

If you already have the compiled `vhdl-mode.elc' file, put it in the same
directory.  Otherwise, byte-compile the source file:
  Emacs:  M-x byte-compile-file RET vhdl-mode.el RET
  Unix:   emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -f batch-byte-compile vhdl-mode.el

Add the following lines to the `site-start.el' file in the `site-lisp'
directory of your Emacs installation or to your Emacs start-up file `.emacs'
(not required in Emacs 20 and higher):

  (autoload 'vhdl-mode \"vhdl-mode\" \"VHDL Mode\" t)
  (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '(\"\\\\.vhdl?\\\\'\" . vhdl-mode) auto-mode-alist))

More detailed installation instructions are included in the official
VHDL Mode distribution.

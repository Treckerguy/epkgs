If you use feedmail, I invite you to send me some email about it.
I appreciate feedback about problems you find or suggestions for
improvements or added features (even though I can't predict when
I'll incorporate changes).  It's also OK with me if you send me a
note along the lines of \"I use feedmail and find it useful\" or \"I
tried feedmail and didn't find it useful, so I stopped using it\".

It is most useful, when sending a bug report, if you tell me what
version of emacs you are using, what version of feedmail you are
using, and what versions of other email-related elisp packages you
are using.  If in doubt about any of that, send the bug report
anyhow.

=====
A NOTE TO THOSE WHO WOULD CHANGE THIS CODE...  Since it is PD,
you're within your rights to do whatever you want.  If you do
publish a new version with your changes in it, please (1) insert
lisp comments describing the changes, (2) insert lisp comments
that clearly delimit where your changes are, (3) email me a copy
(I can't always consistently follow the relevant usenet groups),
and (4) use a version number that is based on the version you're
changing along with something that indicates you changed it.  For
example,

       (defconst feedmail-patch-level \"123\")
       (defconst feedmail-patch-level \"123-XYZ-mods\")

The point of the last item, of course, is to try to minimize
confusion.  Odds are good that if your idea makes sense to me that
it will show up in some future version of feedmail, though it's
hard to say when releases will tumble out.
=====

This file requires the mail-utils library.

This file requires the smtpmail library if you use
feedmail-buffer-to-smtpmail.  It requires the smtp library if
you use feedmail-buffer-smtp.

This file requires the custom library.  Unfortunately, there are
two incompatible versions of the custom library.  If you don't have
custom or you have the old version, this file will still load and
work properly.  If you don't know what custom is all about and want
to edit your user option elisp variables the old fashioned way,
just imagine that all the \"defcustom\" stuff you see below is really
\"defvar\", and ignore everthing else.  For info about custom, see
<URL:http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/custom/>.

This code does in elisp a superset of the stuff that used to be done
by the separate program \"fakemail\" for processing outbound email.
In other words, it takes over after you hit \"C-c C-c\" in mail mode.
By appropriate setting of options, you can still use \"fakemail\",
or you can even revert to sendmail (which is not too popular
locally).  See the variables at the top of the elisp for how to
achieve these effects (there are more features than in this bullet
list, so trolling through the variable and function doc strings may
be worth your while):

   --- you can park outgoing messages into a disk-based queue and
       stimulate sending them all later (handy for laptop users);
       there is also a queue for draft messages

   --- you can get one last look at the prepped outbound message and
       be prompted for confirmation

   --- removes BCC:/RESENT-BCC: headers after getting address info

   --- does smart filling of address headers

   --- calls a routine to process FCC: lines and removes them

   --- empty headers are removed

   --- can force FROM: or SENDER: line

   --- can generate a MESSAGE-ID: line

   --- can generate a DATE: line; the date can be the time the
       message was written or the time it is being sent

   --- strips comments from address info (both \"()\" and \"<>\" are
       handled via a call to mail-strip-quoted-names); the
       comments are stripped in the simplified address list given
       to a subprocess, not in the headers in the mail itself
       (they are left unchanged, modulo smart filling)

   --- error info is pumped into a normal buffer instead of the
       minibuffer

   --- just before the optional prompt for confirmation, lets you
       run a hook on the prepped message and simplified address
       list

   --- you can specify something other than /bin/mail for the
       subprocess

   --- you can generate/modify an X-MAILER: message header

After a long list of options below, you will find the function
feedmail-send-it. Hers's the best way to use the stuff in this
file:

Save this file as feedmail.el somewhere on your elisp
loadpath; byte-compile it.  Put the following lines somewhere in
your ~/.emacs stuff:

    (setq send-mail-function 'feedmail-send-it)
    (autoload 'feedmail-send-it \"feedmail\")

If you plan to use the queue stuff, also use this:

    (setq feedmail-enable-queue t)
    (autoload 'feedmail-run-the-queue \"feedmail\")
    (autoload 'feedmail-run-the-queue-no-prompts \"feedmail\")
    (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '(\"\\\\.fqm$\" . mail-mode) auto-mode-alist))

though VM users might find it more comfortable to use this instead of
the above example's last line:

    (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '(\"\\\\.fqm$\" . feedmail-vm-mail-mode) auto-mode-alist))

If you end up getting asked about killing modified buffers all the time
you are probably being prompted from outside feedmail.  You can probably
get cured by doing the defadvice stuff described in the documentation
for the variable feedmail-queue-buffer-file-name below.

If you are wondering how to send your messages to some SMTP server
(which is not really a feedmail-specific issue), you are probably
looking for smtpmail.el, and it is probably already present in your
emacs installation.  Look at smtpmail.el for how to set that up, and
then do this to hook it into feedmail:

    (autoload 'feedmail-buffer-to-smtpmail \"feedmail\" nil t)
    (setq feedmail-buffer-eating-function 'feedmail-buffer-to-smtpmail)

Alternatively, the FLIM <http://www.m17n.org/FLIM/> project
provides a library called smtp.el.  If you want to use that, the above lines
would be:

    (autoload 'feedmail-buffer-to-smtp \"feedmail\" nil t)
    (setq feedmail-buffer-eating-function 'feedmail-buffer-to-smtp)

If you are using the desktop.el library to restore your sessions, you might 
like to add the suffix \".fqm\" to the list of non-saved things via the variable
desktop-files-not-to-save.

If you are planning to call feedmail-queue-reminder from your .emacs or
something similar, you might need this:

    (autoload 'feedmail-queue-reminder \"feedmail\")

If you ever use rmail-resend and queue messages, you should do this:

    (setq feedmail-queue-alternative-mail-header-separator \"\")

If you want to automatically spell-check messages, but not when sending
them from the queue, you could do something like this:

    (autoload 'feedmail-mail-send-hook-splitter \"feedmail\")
    (add-hook 'mail-send-hook 'feedmail-mail-send-hook-splitter)
    (add-hook 'feedmail-mail-send-hook 'ispell-message)

If you are using message-mode to compose and send mail, feedmail will
probably work fine with that (someone else tested it and told me it worked).
Follow the directions above, but make these adjustments instead:

    (setq message-send-mail-function 'feedmail-send-it)
    (add-hook 'message-mail-send-hook 'feedmail-mail-send-hook-splitter)

If you use message-mode and you make use of feedmail's queueing
stuff, you might also like to adjust these variables to appropriate 
values for message-mode:

    feedmail-queue-runner-mode-setter
    feedmail-queue-runner-message-sender
     
If you are using the \"cmail\" email package, there is some built-in
support for feedmail in recent versions.  To enable it, you should:

    (setq cmail-use-feedmail t)


I think the LCD is no longer being updated, but if it were, this
would be a proper LCD record.  There is an old version of
feedmail.el in the LCD archive.  It works but is missing a lot of
features.

           response didn't take
        fixes to the argument conventions for the

          by gray@austin.apc.slb.com (Douglas Gray Stephens)); relative

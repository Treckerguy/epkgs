 :commentary "\
- Moving one line at a time is slow, but precise.
- Moving in screenfulls (aka scrolling) ist not fast enough for
  large buffers and is not precise.
Thus you ususally scroll to another part of your large file and
then use the one-line-movement for exact adjustment.

This can be improved if subsequent keystrokes would reduce the
amount of lines scrolled.  Please see the docstring of
`swiss-move-line' for examples that try to explain it.
You'd probably best try it out now.

Actually the term \"Swiss Movement\" is introduced here and it stems
from the *li-variable names that occur in these functions ;-)

Installation:
------------
Put
(require 'swiss-move)
somewhere in you init files and add the keybinding, e.g.:
(global-set-key '[(shift prior)]           'swiss-move-line-up)
(global-set-key '[(shift next)]            'swiss-move-line-down)

 :commentary "\
This library allows you to communicate with Speech Dispatcher.
Usually, the communication goes like this:

  (speechd-open)
  ...
  (speechd-say-text \"Hello, world!\")
  ...
  (speechd-close)

Functions and variables starting with the prefix `speechd--' are considered
internal and you shouldn't use them outside this file.

See docstrings and the Texinfo manual for full details.")

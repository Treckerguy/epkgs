 :commentary "\
This package defines some functions and macros found in lisps other
than Emacs lisp (and maybe other languages too sometime).  History
has shown that a culture can benefit from embracing immigrants so
why should programming languages be any different? :-)

Please send my Emacs lisp implementations of your favorite lisp's
functions and macros so that I can include them here.  Or improve
those already included.

\"*\" is used as prefix because using e.g. `immigrant-filter' instead
of `*filter' just wouldn't be as much fun anymore.")

The function handwrite creates PostScript output containing a
handwritten version of the current buffer..
Other functions that may be useful are

     handwrite-10pt: sets the font size to 10 and finds corresponding
                     values for the line spacing and the number of lines
                     on a page.
     handwrite-11pt: which is similar
     handwrite-12pt: which is also similar
     handwrite-13pt: which is similar, too

     handwrite-set-pagenumber: set and unset page numbering


If you are not satisfied with the type page there are a number of
variables you may want to set.


 Installation

type at your prompt \"emacs -l handwrite.el\" or put this file on your
Emacs-Lisp load path,  add the following into your ~/.emacs startup file

               (require 'handwrite)

\"M-x handwrite\"  or \"Write by hand\"  in the edit menu should work now.


I tried to make it `iso_8859_1'-friendly, but there are some exotic
characters missing.


Known bugs: -Page feeds do not do their work, but are ignored instead.
            -Tabs are not always properly displayed.
            -Handwrite may create corrupt PostScript if it encounters
             unknown characters.

Thanks to anyone who emailed me suggestions!")

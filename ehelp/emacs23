This package provides a pre-packaged `Electric Help Mode' for
browsing on-line help screens.  There is one entry point,
`with-electric-help'; all you have to give it is a no-argument
function that generates the actual text of the help into the current
buffer.

To make this the default, you must do
(require 'ehelp)
(define-key global-map \"\\C-h\" 'ehelp-command)
(define-key global-map [help] 'ehelp-command)
(define-key global-map [f1] 'ehelp-command)")

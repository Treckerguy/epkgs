 :commentary "\
The latest version of oacs is always available from:

- http://www.thecodemill.biz/services/oacs/

Oacs depends on the psgml/nxml and mmm modules to be
installed. Psgml and mmm are available from sourceforge.net:

 - http://psgml.sourceforge.net/
 - http://mmm-mode.sourceforge.net/

Nxml is an alternative to psgml and available from:


Psgml/nxml can be installed along side one another. Oacs defaults
to psgml if both are installed unless oacs-preferred-xml-mode is set
to nxml.

Color-occur is not required but highly recommended. Especially in
combination with the various M-oo* keystrokes. (See oacs-occur.el)

- http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/color-occur.el

Besides oacs specific variables, oacs uses the common Emacs
variables:

 - user-full-name
 - user-mail-address

Set them in your .emacs file and your full name and e-mail address
will be included in all OpenACS headers.

Oacs adds several DTDs to psgml, which in order to use need to be
installed. The set consists of common HTML DTDs as well as a DTD
for the OpenACS specific XQL format. You can find a complete set as
added by oacs at:

- http://www.thecodemill.biz/repository/oacs-dtds.tgz

Installation instructions are included in the archive. If you
prefer nxml over psgml install XXX instead. Download XXX from:

- http://www.thecodemill.biz/repository/oacs-XXX.tgz

Oacs variables can be customized using:

 - M-x customize-group oacs
 
Oacs is intended to have as little side effects as
possible. However, it does set various psgml and mmm
variables. Should they clash with your preferences simply remove
them from oacs.")

 :commentary "\
This code sets a buffer-local variable to t if toggle-emacs-lock is run,
then if the user attempts to exit Emacs, the locked buffer name will be
displayed and the exit aborted.  This is just a way of protecting
yourself from yourself.  For example, if you have a shell running a big
program and exiting Emacs would abort that program, you may want to lock
that buffer, then if you forget about it after a while, you won't
accidentally exit Emacs.  To unlock the buffer, just goto the buffer and
run toggle-emacs-lock again.")

This is a spot of code to help filladapt work with the various possible
nroff comment prefixes, such as \\\" .\\\" and '''.  See the docstring in
`nroff-filladapt-setups' below for the details.

Install

Put nroff-filladapt.el somewhere in your load-path and add to your .emacs

    (autoload 'nroff-filladapt-setups \"nroff-filladapt\")
    (add-hook 'nroff-mode-hook 'nroff-filladapt-setups)

You should enable filladapt separately.  If you want it on by default
then

    (add-hook 'nroff-mode-hook 'turn-on-filladapt-mode)")

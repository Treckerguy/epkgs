M-x cheezburger
Now with 100% more cheezy goodness!

This is my first experiment with elisp. Comments and criticisms (And patches) welcome!

Future Ideas:

Offer to open videos in a browser
Add support for the rest of the I Can LOL network
Save the first image, and inform the user when they reach where they started last session

Compatibility:

Only tested on GNU Emacs 23.0.60.1
Should work on 21+ if you have json and url")

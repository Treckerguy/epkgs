This file is for lazy people wanting to swap buffers without
typing C-x b on each window. This is useful when you have :

+--------------+-------------+
|              |             |
|    #emacs    |    #gnus    |
|              |             |
+--------------+-------------+
|                            |
|           .emacs           |
|                            |
+----------------------------+

and you want to have :

+--------------+-------------+
|              |             |
|    #gnus     |   .emacs    |
|              |             |
+--------------+-------------+
|                            |
|           #emacs           |
|                            |
+----------------------------+

With buffer-move, just go in #gnus, do buf-move-left, go to #emacs
(which now should be on top right) and do buf-move-down.

To use it, simply put a (require 'buffer-move) in your ~/.emacs and
define some keybindings. For example, i use :

(global-set-key (kbd \"<C-S-up>\")     'buf-move-up)
(global-set-key (kbd \"<C-S-down>\")   'buf-move-down)
(global-set-key (kbd \"<C-S-left>\")   'buf-move-left)
(global-set-key (kbd \"<C-S-right>\")  'buf-move-right)")

Simple tests for win-switch under a variety of configurations
 and window arrangements. Produces a results summary in a separate
 frame or window.

 To use, either load or require this file (depending on where it is installed),
 e.g.,

     (load-file \"ws-tests.el\") ; use appropriate path

 and then execute M-x ws-test-run-all

 New tests and test suites can be easily defined using
 `ws-test' and `def-ws-test-suite'. Fixtures (i.e.,
 win-switch parameter settings) can be inherited and combined
 relatively simply as well. The examples at the bottom of this file
 are a good place to start and illustrate the api and main options.

 Admittedly, all these features might be a bit of overkill.
 (Do we need tests for the tests now?) But as the examples show,
 it does provide what it is meant to: an extensible framework
 for testing win-switch mode under various configurations.

 Known Issues:

 On Carbon Emacs 22, the Vertical Resizing 1 test can fail at random
 when the main frame is small at start up. Enlarging the frame by
 a couple lines fixes the problem. I'm looking into this.

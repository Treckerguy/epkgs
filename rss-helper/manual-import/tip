rss-helper.el implements functions to aid in the use of Emacs/Gnus
as an RSS reader/aggregator.

Currently rss-helper-gnus-subscribe is the only really interesting
function and you may want to bind a key to it, e.g:

   (global-set-key \"\\C-crf\" 'rss-helper-gnus-subscribe)

Now, whenever you come across a weblog or news site for which
you what to subscribe, invoke rss-helper-gnus-subscribe and it
will find the RSS feed (using a partial implementation Mark
Pilgrim's (http://diveintomark.org/) Ultra-Liberal RSS Locator
algorithm) and subscribe you to it in Gnus.

NOTE: This file has the function nnrss-save-server-data
redefined so that any new subscriptions you make are saved
between sessions.

TODO:
  - Allow the user to pick from among multiple feeds any time
    they are found.  Currently, you are allowed to choose from
    among multiple fees only if the Syndic8 is contacted.
  - Find a way to bail early if Gnus is not up and running.
  - Offer to synchronize RSS subscriptions with Syndic8
    account so that a user can read news from multiple
    machines.
  - Integrate with nnrss.")

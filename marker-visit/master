 :commentary "\
This file provides a simple way to navigate among marks in a
buffer.  C-u C-SPC is similar, but takes you haphazardly around the
buffer.  Setting bookmarks is a lot of extra work if you just want
to jump around your buffer quickly; plus, you have to come up with
a name for every bookmark.

All the marks you've left while editing a buffer serve as bread
crumb trails of areas in the buffer you've edited.  It is
convenient to navigate back and forth among these marks in order.
This file provides two methods to do just that, marker-visit-prev
and marker-visit-next.  These two functions will take you, from
point, to the nearest mark in either direction.  The function
marker-visit-truncate-mark-ring will truncate the mark ring.

The marks you can visit in a buffer consist of: \"the mark\" plus the
contents of the mark-ring.")

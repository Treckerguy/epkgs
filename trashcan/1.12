The file trashcan.el contains a recoverable file deletion system
that behaves like the trash can or recycle bin that many operating
systems, present and past, show on their screens. This system
creates special directories known as trashcan directories to hold
files that can be deleted (permanently) or undeleted (restored /
recovered). On Unix systems there is one trashcan directory for
each user and the default values are $HOME/.TRASHCAN for each value
of $HOME. On Windows systems there are trashcan directories at the
following default locations: a:\\TRASHCAN, b:\\TRASHCAN, c:\\TRASHCAN
etc.

This system changes the behaviour of the \"x\" key in dired mode from
permanently deleting files to a two stage system. If you are not in
a trashcan directory, then the selected files are moved into a
trashcan directory. If you are already in a trashcan directory, the
the selected files are permanently deleted. Files in a trashcan
directory can be restored by viewing that directory in dired mode,
selecting some files and executing the command M-x
trashcan-restore. All of the files in a trashcan directory can also
be permanently deleted in one hit by issuing the command M-x
trashcan-empty. The name \"trashcan\" comes from my old Amiga
computer which I still have fond memories of!

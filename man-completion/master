 :commentary "\
This spot of code extends M-x man with completion of man page names and
filenames, and a new default page name at point which collapses hyphens
(like nroff uses in formatted pages) and can optionally transform some
perl class names.

iman.el does similar page name completion, with info documents too, but
not filename completion.  As of rev 2.22 it has the section number like
\"cat(1)\" and sets \"require-match\" so if you've got cat(1) and catdoc(1)
then you end up having to type \"cat(\" to differentiate, which is a bit
annoying.

woman.el does a similar completion too, by going through /usr/share/man
etc to get a filename.  That's also what \"bash_completion\" does
(http://www.caliban.org/bash/index.shtml#completion).  But the strategy
in man-completion.el is to ask man what pages are available, rather than
digging.  It can potentially get aliases man has found with lexgrog but
which don't have symlinks (or \".so\" pages).")

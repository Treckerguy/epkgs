* Description

cppref.el is a port of Perl's cppref command, a simple C++
reference viewer working on a terminal.

* Usage

cppref.el requires cl and emacs-w3m installed in advance. So, add
the lines below into your .emacs:

  (require 'cppref)

Althogh cppref.el automatically find out the place of
documentation, if you want to put your the directory at some other
place, you must add one more line like below:

  (setq cppref-doc-dir \"/path/to/dir\") ;; doesn't end with \"/\"

Then run `cppref' command and type like \"vector::begin\",
\"io::fopen\", or so.

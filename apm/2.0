This module allows APM to be used from within (X)Emacs. APM is the power
management module available on Linux machines running on PCs. APM can be
used to track the remaining battery charge, to suspend or put in standby the
PC and to also perform various actions when the battery level reaches a low
threshold watermark.

In the current release, no support is provided for taking actions based on
the battery level. This release only supports using the functionality
provided by the command \"apm\" from within (X)Emacs and to also display the
battery status in the modeline.

The user can configure the following parameters:

    The command used to obtain status (by default \"apm\")
    Whether the battery status is displayed in the modeline
    If the battery status is displayed, how often the display is updated.
    The format of the output (remaining time in minutes or hours)")

 :commentary "\
This package allows you to use iswitchb-like functionality to
switch to not only your current buffers, but also any files in your
previously built filecache (see filecache.el).  This experience is
liberating; you no longer need to worry whether the file you want
to go to is open in emacs or not, you just have a single command
(C-x b) to go to a buffer containing that file.  You don't have to
worry whether to press C-x b to switch to a buffer or to use C-x
C-f basename C-TAB to open a file using filecache.

This package is smart enough to uniquify name clashes between
multiple files with the same basename.  All buffers are at the
beginning of the input list presented by iswitchb, and all
filecache entries are at the end.

To use, place the file in your load-path and add

(require 'iswitchb-fc)

to your ~/.emacs, which causes the function iswitchb to refer to
the new function iswitchb-fc.  Presumably you'd add the above line
only if you have (iswitchb-mode 1) in your ~/.emacs already,
otherwise you probably wouldn't care about this package.  To undo
the effect of loading this package, you would need to do M-x
load-library iswitchb RET.

This package may only work on GNU Emacs.  Untested on XEmacs,
but patches will be accepted.

Thanks to Kin Cho (kin@neoscale.com) for the idea and for pointing
me in the right direction.")

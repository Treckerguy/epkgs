Automagically guess what is the language of a buffer.

This works basically by counting occurrences of common words in
every language that is known and comparing respective numbers.
Languages currently supported are english, french, german, danish,
polish, spanish and somewhat russian (based on loosely collected
words from various .po files ... does anybody want to help ?).

guess-lang.el is based on an idea from Pascal Courtois
<Pascal.Courtois@nouvo.com> but evolved a lot.

Because ispell.el doesn't use hooks, guess-lang use is a little bit
tricky and ask you to add things like the two following examples in
your emacs initialization file.

(add-hook 'latex-mode-hook
	  (lambda ()
	    (ispell-change-dictionary (guess-lang-buffer-cached))))

(add-hook 'message-send-hook
	     (lambda ()
	       (ispell-change-dictionary (guess-lang-message))
	       (ispell-message)))

You may try to use the following with \"experimental\" versions of
ispell (add-hook 'ispell-hook 'guess-lang-set-ispell-dictionnary)

To do:
- add support for aliases again
- notify when no dictionnary can be loaded
- explain how to make new frequency tables of keywords.
- speed up execution
- get rid of functional thingies like <html> or \\begin{section}
- in case of huge buffers, use a better algorithm to check only
  relevant parts

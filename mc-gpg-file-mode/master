Abstract:

This mode helps you to handle gpg encrypted files in emacs
comfortably. This can be useful to store secrets (passwords etc.)
When you open a file with ending 'gpg' it gets decrypted and
displayed in emacs and it gets encrypted just before you save
it. Similar to auto-compression-mode for '.gz' files just that you
need your pass-phrase for decryption.

How to use this:

* make sure that mailcrypt is installed and functional

* Put this file in a place where emacs can find it. e.g. put this
  in your .emacs file:

  (setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name \"~/sw/share/emacs/site-lisp\") load-path)) 

  and put this file in the directory ~/sw/share/emacs/site-lisp

* Put this in your .emacs file:

  (require 'mailcrypt)
  (mc-setversion \"gpg\")
  (require 'mc-gpg-file-mode)

* Optionally put something like this in your .emacs if your gpg
  user id does not match your account name or such

  (setq mc-gpg-user-id \"josef.bauer.nospam@web.de\")

* Just open a gpg encrypted file in emacs and 'hope' that it gets
  decrypted after loading

Dependencies:

mailcrypt as found at http://mailcrypt.sourceforge.net. This
version of mc-gpg-file-mode should work with mailcrypt version
3.5.8.

Compatability:

This version of mc-gpg-file-mode was tested with (GNU) emacs
21.3.1, gpg 1.2.4 and mailcrypt 3.5.8 on linux 2.6 (SuSE 9.1).

History:

For a long time I used an encrypted file for passwords and such
that I manually en- and decrypted using mailcrypt in emacs. Then I
started to write a generic mode that decrypted the buffer after
loading. When I found mc-auto-encrypt.el I extended my mode to
automatically encrypt the file before writing.")

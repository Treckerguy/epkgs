 :commentary "\
Keats is a mode for storing notes about Emacs key bindings so you
easier remember them.

To use Keats, make sure that this file is in Emacs load-path
(add-to-list 'load-path \"/path/to/directory/or/file\")

Then require Keats
(require 'keats)

To start Keats
(keats-mode t) or M-x keats-mode

Keats stores all keats in the file given by the variable
`keats-file'. Change to whatever suits you.
(setq keats-file \"~/emacs.d/keats\")

When you add, edit and delete keats Keats will automatically save
the keats to `keats-file'. The number of changes before save is
determined by `keats-save-at'. Set to nil if no auto saving should
be done.

Many of the Keats commands will prompt for a key sequence. To enter
one, start type the sequence and when done press RET. If you want
to abort, press C-g. To type a key by hand, give prefix key
(C-u). In this prompt the key sequence can be typed by hand. This
is useful if the key contains \"C-g\" or \"RET\".

== ADD (C-c k a)
Will add a new keat if it does not already exist. If it does exists
the edit action will be called with the same key. Read below under
edit.

== EDIT (C-c k e)
Edits an already existing keat.

== DESCRIPTION (C-c k d)
Prints the description for a key sequence.

== REMOVE (C-c k r)
Removes a keat.

== WRITE (C-c k w)
Writes `keats-list' to file. This is done every time Emacs is killed.

== SEARCH (C-c k s)
Searches (without respect to case) in keat descriptions for a given
regexp. If there's at least one hit, `keats-interactive-mode' is
started showing all matching keats.

== INTERACTIVE (C-c k i)
Opens `keats-interactive-mode'.")

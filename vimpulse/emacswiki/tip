 :commentary "\
Vimpulse emulates Vim's most popular features, like Visual mode
and text objects. Vimpulse is a set of modifications to Viper, the
standard library that emulates vi. Vimpulse is not a minor mode;
as soon as it is loaded, Viper will start working in a more
Vim-like way.

Vimpulse is under active development. It works quite well with
GNU Emacs 22.3 and 23.2, as well as XEmacs 21.4.22. Patches and
feature requests are welcome (see also the file CONTRIBUTE in the
repository).

Installation:

If you checked out from Git, run `make' to produce
vimpulse-big.el. If on Windows, you can run compile.bat. Then:

1. Copy vimpulse.el (or vimpulse-big.el) to somewhere in your
   `load-path'.

2. Add the following to your init file:

       (require 'vimpulse)

   If you use Windows, see
   http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/faq3.html

The rest is optional:

3. For linear undo/redo and undo branches, install
   undo-tree.el: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UndoTree

   Just place it in `load-path', and Vimpulse will load it
   automatically. On XEmacs, you can use redo.el instead.

Vimpulse automatically enables Viper. You can temporarily disable
Viper (and Vimpulse) with the \"C-z\" key.")

 :commentary "\
Vimpulse emulates Vim's most useful features, including Visual mode
and text objects.  Vimpulse is a set of modifications to Viper, the
minor mode that emulates vi.  Vimpulse is not a minor mode; as soon
as it is loaded, Viper will start working in a more Vim-like way.

Vimpulse is beta software.  It seems to work quite well with
GNU Emacs 22.3 and 23.1.  There are some problems with Undo in
XEmacs 21.4.22.  Please send us compatibility info about other
versions.

Patches and feature requests are welcome.

Installation:

If you checked out from Git, do `make all' to produce
vimpulse-big.el.  If on Windows, you can run compile.bat.  Then:

1. Copy vimpulse.el (or vimpulse-big.el) to somewhere in your
   load-path, e.g., your site-lisp directory.

2. Comment out and add the following line to your .emacs file:

       (require 'vimpulse)

   If .emacs does not exist, create it.  If you use Windows,
   see http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/faq3.html.

That's all the required steps.  The rest is optional:

3. If using GNU Emacs, download and install
   http://wonderworks.com/download/redo.el to get C-r
   (redo key) to work.  redo.el is included with XEmacs.

Vimpulse automatically enables Viper.  You can temporarily disable
Viper (and Vimpulse) with the C-z key.")

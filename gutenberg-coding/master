This is a spot of code for getting the right coding system when visiting
an EBook or Etext from Project Gutenberg,

Gutenberg files come in various encodings.  Most have a \"Character set
encoding\" in the file, the code here looks for that.

The code works both for a plain .txt file and for a .txt visited from a
.zip file (via `archive-mode').")

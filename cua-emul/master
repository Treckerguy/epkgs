 :commentary "\
This file provides some emulation of CUA style buffer manipulation, in
the form of a minor mode.  In particular it provides the following (I
 think useful) functions:
`cua-emul-next-buffer' -- Switch to the next buffer in the buffer
                          list, like CUA style ctrl-tab.
`cua-emul-previous-buffer' -- Switch to the previous buffer in the
                              buffer list, like CUA style
                              ctrl-shift-tab.
`cua-emul-kill-buffer' -- Kill and maybe save the current buffer,
                          like CUA ctrl-f4.
`cua-emul-kill-frame' -- Kill the current frame, or
                         `save-buffers-kill-emacs' if the current
                         frame is the only one, like CUA alt-f4.

Compatibility:
Tested in Emacs 20.4 and Emacs 21.1/21.2.
Not tested in XEmacs, though I don't think there should be a problem.
The only thing you might have to worry about is that the
keybindings are specified in a way compatible with your Emacs.

Installation:
To use this file, put it somewhere in your load-path, optionally
byte compile it and then add the following to your .emacs:
(require  'cua-emul)
(turn-on-cua-emul-mode)

Alternately:
If you just want the functionality of the above mentioned commands,
but don't want the whole minor mode, the bits you have to pull out
are:
`cua-emul-delete-from-list', both the variable and the function
`cua-emul-invisible-buffers', and whichever of the above mentioned
commands you want.

Note, by default, if you have any keybindings on keys cua-emul-mode
uses, they will not be overriden, if you want to force cua-emul-mode
to override keybindings, set the variable `cua-emul-force' to a
non-nil value.  If you do set `cua-emul-force', you may also want to
set `cua-emul-save-and-restore-keys' to a non-nil value so that
overriden keybindings are restored when `cua-emul-mode' is turned
off.

If you like CUA keybindings a lot you might also want to look at
`pc-selection-mode', `pc-bindings-mode', (both included with Emacs
21) and `cua-mode' by Kim F.  Storm -- see <URL:http://www.cua.dk/>.")

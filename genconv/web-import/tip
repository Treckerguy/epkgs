This package performs various conversions using tables.  There are
currently tables toward ISO Latin1 from html accentuated letters
(you know the kind of &eacute; stuff), from quoted printable
sequences (the ugly =E20 things) or from (La)TeX (things such as
\\'{e}).  To make these conversions handy, I have them in my
default buffer menu. 

To use that package, first compile it, evaluate (require 'genconv)
[Maybe in your .emacs], and try, on a appropriate text (not this
one or you will spoil the translation tables), to use the
following commands html2iso, latex2iso or quotedprintable2iso.")

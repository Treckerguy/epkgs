 :commentary "\
Package to keep track of a list of specified files or the output of
specified commands. The principal variable to modify is
analog-entry-list, which should be set to a list of entries. This
can be modified with:

    M-x customize-variable RET analog-entry-list RET

Each element of analog-entry-list is a list where the car is a file
(or command) and the cdr is an association list of properties.

By default, entries are files, but commands can also be specified.
Each entry can have a list of attributes describing whether the
head or the tail of the output is wanted, how many lines should be
kept, a list of regexps to keep or flush etc. Entries can be
collected into named groups.")

This is a tiny little package to alleviate the pain of having to
switch out of Emacs if you want to view an RFC.
It prompts you for a RFC number and pops up a new buffer with said RFC.
You can specify whether you want to find RFCs locally or on the
internet, in either case the RFC is still opened in Emacs.

Note, you need a working wget type program to get a remote RFC and
view it in Emacs.  If you don't have one, set the variable
`get-rfc-no-wget' to t (in this case, a browser will be opened up
to view the RFC.)

If you do view RFCs in Emacs, rfcview.el is a useful package that
formats them nicely, available at
<URL:http://www.neilvandyke.org/rfcview/rfcview.el>

Two commands are provided:
`get-rfc-view-rfc' -- Prompts for an RFC number and then displays
                      it in a new frame.
`get-rfc-view-rfc-at-point' -- Displays the RFC number at point in
                               a new frame.
`get-rfc-grep-rfc-index' -- Greps for the occurrence of a string in
                            the file rfc-index.txt.

To use this file, place it somewhere in your load path, and then
add the following to your .emacs
(autoload 'get-rfc-view-rfc \"get-rfc\" \"Get and view an RFC\" t nil)
(autoload 'get-rfc-view-rfc-at-point \"get-rfc\" \"View the RFC at point\" t nil)
(autoload 'get-rfc-grep-rfc-index \"get-rfc\" \"Grep rfc-index.txt\" t nil)
You can then bind these functions to a key.")

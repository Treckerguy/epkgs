 :commentary "\
himark.el provides marking of text in a buffer by highlighting.
Unlike transient-mark-mode the marking is permanent and can be
accumulated. One can mark the region, the occurances of a regexp
or a rectangle. The markings in a buffer can be removed with
himark-unset.

For me, a typical application is when I am studying in one or
more emacs buffers the output of some other programs which
contain many lines and columns of numbers, numbers and more
numbers, and I need to find and compare the important ones. Or I
might like to see how often I have used some words in a piece of
text.

Comments / suggestions welcome!")

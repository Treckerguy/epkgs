INTRODUCTION:

  `sigbegone.el' can be used to visually de-emphasize email sigs, especially
  the advertisements appended to messages by some free email account
  providers.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

  The `sigbegone.el' package was written using FSF GNU Emacs 21 on a
  GNU/Linux system, and should work with recent Emacs versions on Unix
  variants.  `sigbegone.el' has not been tested with the XEmacs fork of
  Emacs, and I'd welcome any necessary patches.

  `sigbegone.el' has special support for the VM email reader package
  (`http://www.wonderworks.com/vm/', tested with version 7.19) by Kyle
  E. Jones, and Gnus news and mail reader (`http://www.gnus.org/', very
  minimally tested with version 5.9.0) by Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen.  Neither
  of those packages is required to use `sigbegone.el', however.

INSTALLATION:

  1. Put this `sigbegone.el' file somewhere in your Emacs Lisp load path.

  2. Add the following to your `.emacs' file (or elsewhere):

         (require 'sigbegone)

  3. After either restarting Emacs or loading the package, do:

         M-x sigbegone-customize RET

     and adjust the options however you like.

  4. If you want to exorcize sigs in Emacs programs other than VM or Gnus,
     arrange for the function `sigbegone-exorcize-buffer' to be called
     whenever your program displays a new message in a buffer.  You may also
     wish to bind `sigbegone-denounce-from-point' to a key or menu item for
     the buffer.

HOW TO USE IT:

  By default, many sigs shown in your VM mail reader (or whatever program
  you hooked up to `sigbegone-exorcize-buffer') should be displayed in a
  barely-readable color.  These sigs are known as \"exorcized.\"  If you
  desire to read an exorcised sig, you can move the mouse over it to make it
  temporarily appear in a more visible color.

  To cause `sigbegone.el' to exorcize a sig that it does not currently
  exorcize, you \"denounce\" the sig by positioning the point somewhere on the
  first line of the sig (or on a preceding blank line), and invoking
  `sigbegone-denounce-from-point' (which by default is bound to [C-c C-s] in
  VM.  The sig will be highlighted in white-on-red while you are prompted
  \"Denounce the highlighted sig? (y or n)\".

  `sigbegone.el' uses the `custom' facility of Emacs to store both normal
  options and also a list of the sigs that you've denounced in the past.")

The elisp function `desktop2wmaker' searches the directories in
`desktop2wmaker-dir-list' for .desktop files and builds a
Windowmaker-menu, which is written to `desktop2wmaker-out'. 
After writing the file, the shell-command `desktop2wmaker-postprocess'
is run on it. Make sure that your LANG-variable and
`desktop2wmaker-lang' are set properly. `desktop2wmaker' does not try to
recreate the menu of the Gnome/KDE environments, but builds a menu based
on the applications' categories.

In order to use the \"Rebuild menu\" entry, you have to declare
`desktop2wmaker' as autoload and to run gnuserv (and of course (X)Emacs
as well). Put something like this into your init file:

<example>
	(autoload 'desktop2wmaker \"desktop2wmaker\"
	  \"Read *.desktop files and write a WindowMaker menu file.\" t)
	(unless (get-process \"gnuserv\")
	  (gnuserv-start))
</example>

If you don't run (X)Emacs in background all the time, change the value
of `desktop2wmaker-preferred-rebuild-method' to \"emacs\" or invoke the
function as =(desktop2wmaker nil \"emacs\")=. From the shell, you could
run this function as:

<example>
	emacs -batch -vanilla -l PATH_TO_DESKTOP2WMAKER.EL -eval '(desktop2wmaker t \"emacs\")'
</example>

The `desktop2wmaker-out' menu file can be included in WMRootMenu by
inserting something like this:

<example>
	(Desktop, OPEN_MENU, \"~/GNUstep/Defaults/desktop-menu\"),
</example>")

TODO
visualization:
  - colorized output
  - support sorting
  - custom formats, like ibuffer
  - customize window behavior
  - customizable exit action such as restore window configuration
timer modification:
  - create timer
  - delete timer
  - change timer--time
  - change timer--function

FIXME
if the list of timers changes while we are in the buffer,
itimer-current-timer could return the wrong timer.

note to self, here are some important functions:
timer--activate      timer--args
timer--function      timer--high-seconds
timer--idle-delay    timer--low-seconds
timer--repeat-delay  timer--time
timer--time-less-p   timer--triggered
timer--usecs         timer-activate
timer-activate-when-idle     timer-create
timer-duration       timer-event-handler
timer-inc-time       timer-next-integral-multiple-of-time
timer-relative-time  timer-set-function
timer-set-idle-time  timer-set-time
timer-set-time-with-usecs    timer-until

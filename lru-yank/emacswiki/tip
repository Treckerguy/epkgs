Implements LRU (Least Recently Used) stacking for kill-ring.

By default Emacs treats the kill-ring as a \"ring\", I find it more useful
to move each yanked item to the top of a stack instead.  This way
recently used (inserted) stuff are always at the top -- think alt-tab in
Windows.


Installation:

  Put this file into your load-path and the following into your
  ~/.emacs:

  (require 'LRU-yank)
  (setq LRU-yank-mode t)

Implements LRU (Least Recently Used) stacking for kill-ring.

By default Emacs treats the kill-ring as a \"ring\", I find it more useful
to move each yanked item to the top of a stack instead.  This way
recently used (inserted) stuff are always at the top -- think alt-tab in
Windows.

Before using this package, you should try M-- M-y (negative prefix arg to
yank-pop), as it may already do what you want.")

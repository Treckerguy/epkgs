 :commentary "\
This program enables you to write annotation in *Help* and
third-party help systems. When we do programming, we often use
Emacs help system (ie. describe-function). Do you want to take a
note in the *Help* buffer and want Emacs to show your note later?
In other words, integration of Emacs help and your memo!")

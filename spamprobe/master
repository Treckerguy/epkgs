I use spamprobe <URL:http://spamprobe.sourceforge.net/> to help me manage
my incoming mail and, because of this, I wrote spamprobe.el to provide me
with a small set of emacs based spamprobe tools.

This code might only be useful to you if you handle UCE in a similar way
to how I do. I (attempt to) deliver all UCE to an mbox mail folder called
~/Mail/Junk. All mail in there should contain a \"X-SpamProbe:\" header
(added to each email by a procmail rule). I then retain all that UCE so I
can see how well spamprobe is doing.

The latest version of spamprobe.el can be found at:

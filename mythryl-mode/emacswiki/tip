 :commentary "\
A major mode for editing the Mythryl programming language.

This version of mythryl mode is derived from Stefan Monnier's
sml-mode. See http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~monnier/elisp/, but
as of August 2009, the instructions on that page for accessing
the svn repository were incorrect.

To use this mode, install the elisp files from the sml-mode
suite from the above URL somewhere in your elisp load path,
along with this file. Insert the expression:
(load \"mythryl-mode\")
Somewhere in your .emacs file.

Other useful lines for your .emacs (to automatically activate
mythryl-mode)

;; for .pkg and .api files
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append '((\"\\\\.pkg$\" . mythryl-mode)
                (\"\\\\.api$\" . mythryl-mode))
              auto-mode-alist))

;; for scripts starting with #!/.../mythryl
(setq interpreter-mode-alist
      (append '((\"mythryl\" . mythryl-mode))
              interpreter-mode-alist))

This revision of mythryl was released on 11 Feb 2010 by Michele
Bini and includes simple indentation support.")

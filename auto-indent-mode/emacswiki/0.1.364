Provides auto-indentation minor mode.  This allows the following:

 (1) Return automatically indents the code appropriately (if enabled)

 (2) Pasting/Yanking indents the appropriately

 (3) Killing line will take off unneeded spaces (if enabled)

 (4) On visit file, indent appropriately, but DONT SAVE. (Pretend like
 nothing happened, if enabled)

 (5) On save, optionally unttabify, remove trailing white-spaces, and
 definitely indent the file (if enabled).

 (6) TextMate behavior of keys if desired (see below)

 All of these options can be customized. (customize auto-indent)

 To use put this in your load path and then put the following in your emacs
 file:

 (setq auto-indent-on-visit-file t) ;; If you want auto-indent on for files
 (require 'auto-indent-mode)

 If you (almost) always want this on, add the following to ~/.emacs:

 (auto-indent-global-mode)

 Excluded modes are defined in `auto-indent-disabled-modes-list'

 If you only want this on for a single mode, you would add the following to
 ~/.emacs

 (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'auto-indent-minor-mode)

 You could always turn on the minor mode with the command
 `auto-indent-minor-mode'")

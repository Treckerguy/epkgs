 :commentary "\
This provides a mode for editing literate Haskell with the LaTeX
\\begin{code}...\\end{code} convention (but not the `Bird tracks'
`inverse comment' convention).

It originally was meant to use my simple Haskell mode rather than
the one from haskell.org.  Versions of the haskell.org
haskell-indent.el prior to v2.1 (?) need to be modified to work
with this, due to the narrowing used by multi-mode around the
indentation command.  That has been fixed subsequently, so the
current version can be used with this code.  However, note that the
recommended way of installing it adds `literate-haskell-mode' to
`auto-mode-alist' for .lhs files, whereas we want `haskell-latex'.
Thus you probably want to do something like this, assuming
haskell-latex is on `load-path' and $haskell_mode_path is the path
name of the haskell-latex directory:

  (load \"$haskell_mode_path/haskell-site-file.el\")
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.l[gh]s\\\\'\" . haskell-latex-mode))
  (autoload 'haskell-latex-mode \"haskell-latex\")

Alternatively, you can customize `haskell-mode-hook' by adding
`haskell-latex-maybe' to it.

You can use the Emacs LaTeX mode or AUCTeX.  The latter causes
trouble which is hacked around in the multi-mode.el (revision
1.6+).  There are problems with font-locking in Emacs 21, both with
AUCTeX and the built-in mode, which seem to be fixed in Emacs 22 --
single `$'s in Haskell parts cause subsequent LaTeX to be fontified
as maths.")

 :commentary "\
This file helps with the process of converting between different
variants of English.  Often, you have text which you want to publish
in different places with different requirements for spellings and
dialect.  While ispell.el can help with this, it is a little
cumbersome; if the text has already spell checked previous in a
different dialect, then it is irritating to have to skip all the
abbreviations and specialist words again.

There are only three entry points `variant-translate-buffer' and
`variant-translate-region', which do pretty much what you expect.
You can change language variants with `variant-set-language'. There
are two real English variantions, \"british-ise\" and \"british-ize\"
for those people who like z's.


There is one non-use function, `variant-create-abbc-list' which
generates the file which contains the data. This uses the word
lists from http://wordlist.sourceforge.net. This expects an
existing file called variant-abbc.el.")

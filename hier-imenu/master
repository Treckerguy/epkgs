 :commentary "\
Creates an index-menu (using `imenu'), that reflects the
hierarchical structure of your documents, either with indentation
only, or with ASCII drawing.

Sample configurations are given for latex-mode (both standard FSF's
one and the one from AUC), html-mode.  Support for FWEB-mode has
moved to my `web-mode.el'

Bug reports, comments, and suggestions are welcome!

WARNING: included support for LaTeX-mode will not work in Emacs 20.6
or older, or in Xemacs using packages dated 2000.01.24 of older, unless
you upgrade `imenu.el' !!  Please visit the homepage for updated versions.

WARNING: variables `hier-imenu-do-*' have been obsoleted by
`hier-imenu-style'.

WARNING: variable `hier-imenu-max-item-length' has been obsoleted
by `imenu-max-item-length', and moved to `imenu.el'.")

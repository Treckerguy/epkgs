 :commentary "\
This library provides easy project management and navigation. The
concept of a project is pretty basic - just a folder containing
special file. Currently git, mercurial and bazaar repos are
considered projects by default. If you want to mark a folder
manually as a project just create an empty .projectile file in
it. Some of projectile's features:

* jump to a file in project
* jump to a project buffer
* multi-occur in project buffers
* grep in project
* regenerate project etags
Installation:

(require 'projectile)
(projectile-global-mode) ;; to enable in all buffers

To enable projectile only in select modes:

(add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook #'(lambda () (projectile-mode)))")

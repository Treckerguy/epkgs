Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a form of instant communication over
the Internet. It is mainly designed for group (many-to-many)
communication in discussion forums called channels, but also allows
one-to-one communication.

Rcirc has simple defaults and clear and consistent behavior.
Message arrival timestamps, activity notification on the modeline,
message filling, nick completion, and keepalive pings are all
enabled by default, but can easily be adjusted or turned off.  Each
discussion takes place in its own buffer and there is a single
server buffer per connection.

Open a new irc connection with:
M-x irc RET")

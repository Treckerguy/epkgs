 :commentary "\
Note: Some parts of this file handler are unnecessary in Emacs 21.1 and
later (which finally handles zero-length files in the normal way by just
reading them to eof; see Gerd Moellmann's change of 2001-04-18).  But if
you are using an older version of Emacs, read on.

Linux /proc files are not ordinary files and cannot by visited by emacs
in the normal way.  This handler makes it possible to view, edit, and
(when allowed) save the contents of /proc files with emacs.

Linux /proc files are also inconsistent about returning modification
times: some files will always return the current time as the mod time,
some only change when there is new data, others never change after the
proc entry is first created (for an example of the last case, see
/proc/mdstat in kernel versions 2.6.10 or 2.6.11).  It's difficult to
tell what behavior is most useful in these situations.  Some files can
be written to modify kernel parameters and the modtime for these should
not appear to change or you get \"file on disk is newer\" warnings in
emacs.  Other times, e.g. with auto-revert-mode, the file modtime should
be updated so that the buffer display keeps up with the latest contents.

The heuristic employed here is that writable files are considered not to
have changed on disk (so that saving changes is less annoying), but
read-only files are always newer (so that auto-revert, etc. work).

This package cannot be autoloaded.  To use it, put the following in your
.emacs:

    (require 'linuxproc)

Thanks to Ralph Schleicher <rs@purple.ul.bawue.de> for discovering a
method of reading files in /proc by abusing the load reader.")

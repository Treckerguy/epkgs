This package provides basic functionality to perform searches on LDAP
   servers.  It requires a command line utility generally named
   `ldapsearch' to actually perform the searches.  That program can be
   found in all LDAP developer kits such as:
     - UM-LDAP 3.3 (http://www.umich.edu/~dirsvcs/ldap/)
     - OpenLDAP (http://www.openldap.org/)")

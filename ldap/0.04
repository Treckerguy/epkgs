Since I'm currently working on testing an LDAP server, I needed
(well wanted) some routines to look up people on the server and
return me their email addresses.

It currently relies on having the \"ldapsearch\" executable in your
path (it's part of the Uni of Michigan LDAP stuff, which you can
find at http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/ldap/)")

This program adds simple blog publishing support to org-mode. It is
built on top of org-publish.el.

You should read the documentation for org-publish.el before
continuing.

The latest version of this program, and of org-publish.el, can be
found at: http://dto.freeshell.org/notebook/OrgMode.html

1. Basic configuration

   First add (require 'org-blog) to your emacs initialization file. 

   Then set the variable org-blog-directory (you can also leave it
   as the default, \"~/blog/\"). This directory should be different
   from the directory where your normal *.org files are stored,
   otherwise they will get \"posted\".

   You should also set the variable
   org-blog-unfinished-directory. The default is
   \"~/blog/unfinished\". This is the directory where unfinished
   posts are stored. You can leave posts in the unfinished
   directory while you are working on them, and they won't be
   published.

2. Create a post 

   Use M-x org-blog-new-post. You'll be prompted for a
   filename. Enter a short name for this post (without the \".org\")
   and press RET. You'll see a new buffer with a blank TITLE field.

   You can work on more than one post at once. They'll all be
   stored in your `org-blog-unfinished-directory'. To view a list
   of posts in progress, use M-x
   org-blog-find-unfinished-posts. You'll see the directory listing
   of `org-blog-unfinished-directory', and you can use RET to
   select a post to edit.

3. Finish a post

   When your post is ready, visit the file and hit M-x
   org-blog-finish-post. This does not mean the post is published
   on your website, only that the post is \"finished\" and given a
   timestamped filename. Your blog post and updated index will be
   published when you execute M-x org-publish-all.

   But first, let's take a detour to make sure blog publishing is
   set up properly.")

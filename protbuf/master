 :commentary "\
This package allows you to make it harder to kill buffers accidentally,
e.g. by being too trigger happy selecting items in the buffer menu.
protect-process-buffer-from-kill-mode is perhaps the more useful of the
two, making it harder to accidentally kill shell buffers without
terminating the process in them first.")

 :commentary "\
There are three main areas of functionality:

* Wrap common network utility programs (ping, traceroute, netstat,
nslookup, arp, route). Note that these wrappers are of the diagnostic
functions of these programs only.

* Implement some very basic protocols in Emacs Lisp (finger and whois)

* Support connections to HOST/PORT, generally for debugging and the like.
In other words, for doing much the same thing as \"telnet HOST PORT\", and
then typing commands.

PATHS

On some systems, some of these programs are not in normal user path,
but rather in /sbin, /usr/sbin, and so on.")

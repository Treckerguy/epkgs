Sinasi Is Not A SproutCore IDE

Anything good about Sinasi is the work of Phil Hagelberg and Eric
Schulte.  Anything bad is the fault of Eric Kidd.

Sinasi is a hacked copy of Rinari, an excellent Emacs toolkit for
working with Rails applications.  Sinasi ports a few of the many Rinari
features to work with SproutCore applications.  In particular, it allows
you to flip between models, unit tests, fixtures, controllers, etc., in
a SproutCore source tree.

You need to install Rinari and js2.el to get this working,
at least for now.  Eventually, I might add support for installing via
ELPA.

Please feel free to fork this project on github and enhance it.")

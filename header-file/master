 :commentary "\
By assigning header-file-mode to .h files in auto-mode-alist, header files
we be opened in the mode used by the corresponding implementation file (as
determined by the `find-file' package). If a corresponding file cannot be
found, the mode assigned in `header-file-default-mode' is used. This is not
a proper mode in its own right, simply a trampoline to other modes.")

This file provides a function `scratch' that is similar to `shell',
`info', `grep', and other such functions.  By this I mean M-x
scratch takes you to the *scratch* buffer if one exists, otherwise
it generates a new *scratch* buffer.  User-defined customizations
along the following lines allow you to choose a new name for the
scratch buffer, or to use a different major mode, or to add minor
modes:

(defun itch () (interactive)
  (scratch \"*itch*\"))

(defun notes () (interactive)
  (scratch \"*notes*\" 'text-mode))

(defun music () (interactive)
  (scratch \"*music*\" 'fundamental-mode 
                     'musical-letters-mode 
                     'auto-fill-mode))

The function `back-from-scratch' is also provided, to take you
back from your most recent scratch buffer to the previous buffer
(restoring the window configuration).

For those who are interested primarily in the typical *scratch*
buffer the documentation of `lisp-interaction-mode' should be
required reading.")

This gives you two top-level-functions useful when programming lisp:
cltl2-view-function-definition and cltl2-view-index
cltl2-view-function-definition asks you for a name of a lisp
function (or variable) and will open up your favourite browser
(as specified by `browse-url-browser-function') loading the page
which documents it.

Installation: (as usual)
Put browse-cltl2.el somewhere where emacs can find it.
browse-cltl2.el requires a working browse-url, url and cl.
Insert the following lines in your .emacs:

     (autoload 'cltl2-view-function-definition \"browse-cltl2\")
     (autoload 'cltl2-view-index \"browse-cltl2\")
     (autoload 'cltl2-lisp-mode-install \"browse-cltl2\")
     (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook 'cltl2-lisp-mode-install)
     (add-hook 'ilisp-mode-hook 'cltl2-lisp-mode-install)

This should also add the needed hooks to lisp-mode (and ilisp-mode).

Gnu Emacs:
For Gnu Emacs there doesn't seem to be a lisp-mode-hook so you're
on your own with the key-settings.
No url.el:
If you don't have url.el set *cltl2-use-url* to nil
and set *cltl2-fetch-method* to 'local or 'local-index-only.
This implies that you need a local copy of the index page of
CLtL2 (which you can get from the normal hypertext-version at CMU),
so you need to point *cltl2-local-file-pos* and *cltl2-index-file-name*
to the place where you put it.
Old versions of Emacs (Emacs 19.29 and XEmacs 19.11 for example):
When you want to use a local copy (or a local copy of the index file)
check the documentation on find-file-noselect. If it doesn't mention
an option called RAWFILE set *cltl2-old-find-file-noselect* to 't.


Customization:
By default, browse-cltl2 will use a local copy of CLtL2, looking
for it in /usr/doc/html/cltl. This can be modified with the help
of the following variables:
*cltl2-fetch-method*, *cltl2-url*, *cltl-local-file-pos*
See the documentation on this variables for more info.")

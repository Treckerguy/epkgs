 :commentary "\
This provides a mechanism by which you can run emacs in server mode
in a screen session.  When emacs is run, it will automatically
switch to the screen window with emacs server running.  When
finished in the buffer (C-x #), this will automatically switch the
user back to the screen window they originated from.

This code does roughly the same as screenserver.el, but does not
rely on temporary files for Emacs<->screen communication.  On the
downside, it therefore only works with gnuserv.")

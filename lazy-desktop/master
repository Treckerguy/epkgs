 :commentary "\
Desktop is a really nice utility.  Your Emacs will open up as it
was killed.  I like this.  But this means the total number of open
buffers tends to grow large.  Sometimes I kill them all, just for
fun.  What a nasty individual I am.

lazy-desktop does what you'd expect.  It opens up a couple of files
to be starting with.  And then runs everything else in the idle
cycle, opening up buffers slowly, hopefully in a way which should
not annoy you while working.  This way you get (more or less) the
best of both worlds.

To get this to work do (require 'lazy-desktop) in your .emacs.
Obviously you need to have desktop working as well. You need to do
this BEFORE you call `desktop-read', or your emacs will crash when
starting up.

You can set `lazy-desktop-verbose' if you want it to open buffers
in a way which will annoy you while working.")

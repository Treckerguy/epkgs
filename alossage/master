 :commentary "\
Like the standard Emacs function `view-lossage', but with
automatic refresh of lossage information. This package is meant
for teaching Emacs to others: with it, onlookers can see what keys
you press while using Emacs.

The normal way to use this package is to turn on auto-lossage-mode
(with M-x auto-lossage-mode), and then view the *Auto-Lossage*
buffer in another window (use C-x 3) or frame (resize it to about
10 characters wide). M-x auto-lossage-make-frame is a simple way
to activate the package when you can display multiple frames.

Please note that, as with the normal `view-lossage', this mode
displays all the keys you press in Emacs, including passwords and
such. You should probably turn it off when writing passwords or
other sensitive information into Emacs. This mode (and
`view-lossage') can display up to 100 previous keystrokes, so you
may want to type that much before re-enabling it.")

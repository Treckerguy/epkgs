 :commentary "\
recs-mode is a simple command suggestion minor mode for GNU
Emacs. recs-mode is free software, licensed under the GNU GPL.

The latest version of recs-mode can always be found here:

    http://github.com/tlh/recs-mode.el

You can clone the repo by running:

    git clone git://github.com/tlh/recs-mode.el


Say you discover a new, more efficient sequence of commands to do
something.  You want to start using it, but your muscle memory
continues to do it the old way.  Before long you forget the new
way, and nothing changes.  With recs-mode, Emacs can recognize the
old pattern when you use it, and suggest the new the pattern,
training you to be a better Emacs user.

recs-mode works by recording the names of the commands you enter
into a ring-like string, which is then matched against a list of
command name regular expressions.  When a match is detected,
recs-mode suggests a more efficient way of doing things.  recs-mode
looks strictly at sequences of commands, not sequences of
keystrokes, avoiding complications resulting from different
keybindings in different modes.

The advantage of this approach is that we can detect any command
sequence that a regexp is powerful enough to match.

The disadvantage of this approach is that we can only detect
command sequences that a regexp is powerful enough to match.")

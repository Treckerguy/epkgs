 :commentary "\
The purpose of this file is to set up `slime-lisp-implementations'
to allow SLIME to communicate with the Swank server implemented in
Clojure. There are mainly 3 ways to launch a session:

1. Standalone: Configure the swank-clojure-classpath with the
   paths of the jars you wish to use (this should include clojure
   and swank-clojure at the minimum and may also include
   clojure-contrib)and hit M-x slime. 

2. Project: Put your project's dependencies (either manually or using
   Leiningen or Maven) in the directory named by
   `swank-clojure-project-dep-path' (lib/ by default), then launch M-x
   swank-clojure-project. Note that the directory must contain
   swank-clojure in the classpath (either swank-clojure.jar or the
   swank-clojure source repo), it will not automatically be added.

3. Standalone Server: Users of leiningen or clojure-maven-plugin
   can launch a server from a shell
   (http://wiki.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/emacs-integration)
   and connect to it from within Emacs using M-x slime-connect.
   `swank-clojure-lein-swank' can be used to start a leiningen
   interactively from emacs.")

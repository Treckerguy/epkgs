This is tools package for gtk2hs

Because gtk2hs have *huge* code/document need convert.
So i wrote those elisp package for convert quickly in Emacs.

This tool must be use with w3m.


Installation:

Put gtk2hs.el to your load-path.
The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name \"~/elisp\"))

And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.

(require 'gtk2hs)

No need more.")

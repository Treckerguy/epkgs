Someone like to reuse the current dired buffer to visit
another directory, so that you just need open one dired
buffer. but the bad point is ,you can't  easily go
forward and back in different dired directory. this file
can remember dired directory you have visited and list them
using `anything.el'.
`anything-dired-history.el' will save all dired directory you
have visited to file `anything-dired-history-cache-file'


Installation:

(require 'anything-dired-history)
(setq anything-dired-history-cache-file \"~/.emacs.d/dired-history\")
(define-key dired-mode-map \",\" 'anything-dired-history-view)

Or:
(autoload 'anything-dired-history-view \"anything-dired-history\"
   \"view dired directories you have visited.\" t)        
(setq-default anything-dired-history-cache-file \"~/.emacs.d/dired-history\")
(define-key dired-mode-map \",\" 'anything-dired-history-view)")

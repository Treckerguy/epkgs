This  extension adds to the Sunrise Commander file manager a directories-only
tree view that can be used for fast navigation, as well as for several  basic
operations  on  files and directories. It uses the excellent \"tree-widget.el\"
library written by David Ponce and works the same in text consoles as well as
in graphical environments, using either the mouse or just the keyboard.

This is version 1 $Rev: 309 $ of the Sunrise Commander Tree Extension.

 It was developed on GNU Emacs 24 on Linux, and tested on GNU Emacs 22 and 24
for Linux, and on EmacsW32 (version 23) for Windows.

Installation:

1) Put this file somewhere in your emacs load-path.

2)  Add  a (require ’sunrise‐x‐tree) expression to your .emacs file somewhere
after the (require ’sunrise‐commander) one.

3) Evaluate the new expression, or reload your .emacs file, or restart emacs.

4) You may have to customize the tree-widget-image-enable variable if all you
get are text-only icons (e.g. \"[+]\" and \"[X]\") in your graphical environment,
while you'd rather prefer looking at pretty graphical ones.

WARNING: If you use Slime be aware that some versions of this package include
an older version of tree-widget.el that may clobber the one in Emacs and make
this extension work improperly.  At least that's the case in Debian for i386:
slime comes with version 21.4 of tree-widget, but the extension requires 22.1
or better.")

 :commentary "\
The package provides a variety of different ways to interact with
the current working directory of a shell buffer. While Emacs
provides a variety of commands for interacting with the shell, and
an array of commands for doing many of the tasks that users can do
from the shell (deleting, moving and copying files for instance),
using an interactive shell within Emacs is none the less an
intuitive way of augmenting Emacs' functionality, with that
provided by the native shell. 

One of the difficulties with this though, is that the user often
wishes to use the shell in many different working directories. This
is particularly true, with some languages, such as Java, which
require frequent traversal of many directories.

This package provides a number of ways of helping this
process. More descriptions of these ways will be added as I code
them.")

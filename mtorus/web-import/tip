FIXMEs
 - generic interface for special lists, because currently the
   (only) special list (buffer list) behaviour is hard coded in a
   way that's probably not sensible for lists like recent-files or
   the like
 - handling of invalid markers
   -> (don't display, quietly discard?)
   -> the correct while-loop which deletes invalid in
   mtorus-jump-current-marker or mtorus-current-buffer
   -> what happens when a buffer is reverted (or killed and
   reopened)?

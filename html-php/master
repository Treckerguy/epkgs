 :commentary "\
Multiple-mode editing of PHP embedded in HTML.  Subject to the
limitations of multi-mode.el.  Note that there's no attempt to deal
with commented processing instructions markup.  Note also that this
only works properly with the basic HTML mode -- not PSGML or NXML.
Tested with the PHP mode from the hacked CC mode at the above URL.")

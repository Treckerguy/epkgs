Usage

* Installation
Download perlmonks.el from https://github.com/metaperl/emacs-perlmonks
Put this file somewhere on your load-path and in your .emacs put:
(require 'perlmonks)

* Authentication
The first time you use this mode, you need to call perlmonks-login
which will set a cookie which will last for 10 years

* Editing
You initiate your use of this mode by opening up a file with a .monks 
extension. This will open the file with major mode nxml and minor mode 
perlmonks. From that point, you simply write a post using
Perl Monks Approved HTML tags - http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=29281
There are some convenience functions within perlmonks.el for editing:
** Editing Support
perlmonks-paragraph
perlmonks-code
perlmonks-blockquote

* Posting
Once your post is complete, perlmonks.el has support for posting to the
following areas:
 M-x perlmonks-seekers-of-perl-wisdom
 M-x perlmonks-meditation
 M-x perlmonks-reply
Just call one of those commands while in your .monks buffer

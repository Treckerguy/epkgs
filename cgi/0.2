Overview ==========================================================

A simple library for the Common Gateway Interface for Emacs,
allowing you to service requests for non static web pages in elisp.
Provides routines for decoding arguments to GET- and POST-type CGI
requests.

Usage: place a shell script such as the following in your web
server's CGI directory (typically called something like
/var/www/cgi-bin/):

,-------------------------------------------------------------------
| #!/bin/sh
| 
| emacs -batch -l cgi.el -f cgi-calendar
`-------------------------------------------------------------------

(`cgi-calendar' is a sample elisp CGI script provided at the end of
this file).

Alternatively, if you're running version 2.x of the linux kernel
you could make .elc files directly executable via the binfmt_misc
mechanism and run them straight from the cgi-bin directory.

Efficiency would be improved by having Emacs bind to the http
service port and spawn a thread per connection. Extending Emacs to
support server sockets and multithreading is left as an exercise
for the reader.

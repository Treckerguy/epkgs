I grabbed this code from Charles on the
http://www.emacswiki.org/wiki.pl?AutoEncrypt page.  It takes
advantage of the Local Variables auto evaluation feature in files.
By evaluating mc-auto-encrypt when a file is opened you can use
mailcrypt to encrypt a region of the file.

To start encrypting any plain text file add this to the bottom of
the file:

Local Variables:
eval: (mc-auto-encrypt)
End:

Note that you can tell Emacs to automatically evaluate code instead
of asking you. To do so, just add this to your .emacs (Note that you 
shouldn't do it for security reasons):

(setq enable-local-eval t) ;; VERY VERY DANGEROUS !!!

Take a look at the emacs info page on \"File Variables\" for details
on how to specify file local variables and what types of comments
you can place them in.

The mc-auto-encrypt function then gets evaluated when the file is
opened.  It sets up a before-save-hook and a buffer local
after-save-hook to handle the (d)encryption.

Known problems:

When you previously edited a file and adding the Local Variables 
without encrypting the file, this results in an error when opening
it with Emacs. The trick would be to check if the file has been
encrypted before trying to do so.")

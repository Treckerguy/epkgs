This package allows you to protect buffers, based upon their
names, from deletion.

 There are two ways you can use this package to protect buffers,
either via the customize interface, or via Lisp.

 Via Lisp:

 (require 'keep-buffers)                     ;; Load the package.
 (keep-buffers-protect-buffer \"*scratch*\")   ;; Protect the *scratch* buffer
 (keep-buffers-protect-buffer \"*Messages*\")  ;; Protect the *Messages* buffer
 ; (keep-buffers-erase-on-kill t)             ;; Erase the buffer contents on kill attempt


 Via Customize:

  M-x customize-group
  keep-buffers

  Then simply insert the names of the buffers that you'd like protected in
the appropriate field.
  (This will only take effect if you have (require 'keep-buffers) in your .emacs file)")

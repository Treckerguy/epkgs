 :commentary "\
This is a plugin for nnir.el to use grepmail as its search engine.
To use it, put the following in your ~/.gnus:

	(require 'nnir-grepmail)
	(setq nnir-search-engine 'grepmail)

If you have only one nnml and only one nnfolder backend and they
are both part of your gnus-secondary-select-methods, then that
should be it. Otherwise, you may need to customize the variables
nnir-grepmail-nnml-backend and nnir-grepmail-nnfolder-backend. The
defaults are guessed from your gnus-secondary-select-methods which
may or may not be right.

To learn more about nnir.el, read its Commentary section in
ftp://ls6-ftp.cs.uni-dortmund.de/pub/src/emacs/nnir.el.

If you use grepmail 4.48 or greater, you should add -H to
nnir-grepmail-switches. This will greatly reduce the size of the
buffer created by nnir.")

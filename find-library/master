This module can be used to find an Emacs Lisp library with
completion capability. This may be useful when coding an elisp
program on Emacs and want to view another library file. M-x
find-function is probably the most commonly used command, but
sometimes a library name is more convenient, especially if
completion is available.

This command lists shadow libraries as well in the completion list.
Shadow libraries will have suffix \"<number>\" to the library name as
completion string. This provides a convenient way to check the
existence of a shadow, and can proceed to open to see what it is.

A completion table cache is maintained to avoid unnecessary library
scan. Its validity is checked against load-path and modification
time of each directory listed in load-path each time the command is
invoked.


To install, place this file in your load-path (and byte compile if
you like), and add the following in .emacs.

  (autoload 'find-library \"find-library\" \"find-library\" t)

To use, type M-x find-library, then it prompts for a library name
to open. It automatically generates a completion table for all
library files in load-path. It also cache the last entry so that it
will not generate completion list everytime the command is
invoked. The timestamp info of each load-path directory is used to
detect the change in library file listings.

Library loading command is also defined in this module. M-x
find-and-load-library is the command for this. Please add the
following to .emacs for autoload setup.

  (autoload 'find-and-load-library \"find-library\" \"find-library\" t)")

 :commentary "\
Beginning with version 4 of the Sunrise Commander, checkpoints were redefined
to be a special form of bookmarks. Unfortunately, the differences between the
bookmarks  frameworks in Emacs 22 and Emacs 23 are so big that including this
code directly in the sunrise-commander script would make it incompatible with
Emacs  22.  For  this reason both versions of checkpoints are now provided as
dynamically loaded extensions, so that you can decide which of them  to  use.
To  be  sure,  this  is  the version I intend to further develop, as it has a
richer set of functions and integrates more nicely to the rest of Emacs.  The
other  one is deprecated and will eventually disappear once Emacs 23+ becomes
the \"stable\" release.

This is version 1 $Rev: 309 $ of the Sunrise Commander Checkpoints Extension.

It  was  written and tested on GNU Emacs 23 on Linux.

Installation and Usage:

1) Put this file somewhere in your Emacs load-path. (Optionally) compile it.

2)  Enjoy  ;-) -- Sunrise should pick the correct extension automatically. On
Emacs 23 it will look for sunrise-x-checkpoints, while on Emacs 22 it'll  try
to  load  sunrise-x-old-checkpoints. Only if you *really* want to use the old
extensions on Emacs 23 you may add a new (require 'sunrise-x-old-checkpoints)
expression to your .emacs file somewhere after (require 'sunrise-commander).")

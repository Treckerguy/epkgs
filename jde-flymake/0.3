 :commentary "\
This module provides extensions to Flymake, created by Pavel Kobiakov, to
allow the JDEE configuration and the jikes compiler to be used for the
on-the-fly syntax checking of Java files. 

Flymake comes with built-in support for Java but relies on Makefiles for
calling Jikes; this module relies instead on JDEE project variables, removing
the need to create Makefiles just for the purpose of using Flymake.

The advantages of re-using the JDEE configuration are obvious, as it
eliminates the redundancy of keeping the extra configuration required for the
Makefile, specially since Ant is becoming the preferred tool for building
Java projects. 

Jikes is quite fast, can be configured to not generate class
files (which is nice since the purpose of flymake is to do just syntax
checking), and the latest version includes adittional semantic tests derived
from the \"Effective Java\" book which are very useful as well. This feature
has drawbacks as well as some valid constructors (like empty catch blocks)
are flagged as errors.")

Just use 'M-x ascii-display-buffer' to see special characters
highlighted.  You can also do 'M-x ascii-display-file' to display a
file.

*** IMPORTANT NOTE ON CODING SYSTEMS ***

You should be aware of the interaction between Emacs' coding
systems and this package.  In particular, Emacs canonicalizes
Macintosh and MS-DOS line-ending conventions to Unix-style newlines
internally, and converts them back when writing a file.
ascii-display.el tries to show you what the file will actually be,
by noticing that the buffer is in a special coding system, and
displaying the EOL conventions for that coding system.  This is a
lie, because there aren't *really* carriage returns (or whatever)
in the buffer.

In summary, ascii-display tries to do the right thing, but it is no
more than a bad hack.  Don't be surprised if it fails, or gives
unexpected results.

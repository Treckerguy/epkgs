This utility allows you to automatically cut regions to a fortune
file.  In case that the region stems from an article buffer (mail or
news), it will try to automatically determine the author of the
fortune.  It will also allow you to compile your fortune-database
as well as providing a function to extract a fortune for use as your
signature.
Of course, it can simply display a fortune, too.
Use prefix arguments to specify different fortune databases.

Installation:

Please check the customize settings -- you will at least have to
modify the values of `fortune-dir' and `fortune-file'.

I then use this in my .gnus:
(message \"Making new signature: %s\" (fortune-to-signature \"~/fortunes/\"))
This automagically creates a new signature when starting up Gnus.
Note that the call to fortune-to-signature specifies a directory in which
several fortune-files and their databases are stored.

If you like to get a new signature for every message, you can also hook
it into message-mode:
(add-hook 'message-setup-hook 'fortune-to-signature)
This time no fortune-file is specified, so fortune-to-signature would use
the default-file as specified by fortune-file.

I have also this in my .gnus:
(add-hook 'gnus-article-mode-hook
	  '(lambda ()
	     (define-key gnus-article-mode-map \"i\" 'fortune-from-region)))
which allows marking a region and then pressing \"i\" so that the marked
region will be automatically added to my favourite fortune-file.")

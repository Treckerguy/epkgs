This code allows you to browse the list of defined faces and to
quickly call a face customization buffer for the face at point,
thereby facilitating the job of a color theme author.

Loading this code will advise `list-faces-display' to put the *Faces*
buffer into `faces-list-mode'.  That modes provides two extra key
bindings; one of them calls `face-describe' for the face at point,
the other calls `customize-face' for the face at point.

The two functions to describe and customize the face at point can be
called from anywhere; they are `describe-face-at-point' and
`customize-face-at-point'.  If you are working with Emacs and
discover a face you don't like, put point on some text with the
offending face and type M-x customize-face-at-point RET.")

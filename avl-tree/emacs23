 :commentary "\
An AVL tree is a nearly-perfect balanced binary tree.  A tree consists of
two elements, the root node and the compare function.  The actual tree
has a dummy node as its root with the real root in the left pointer.

Each node of the tree consists of one data element, one left
sub-tree and one right sub-tree.  Each node also has a balance
count, which is the difference in depth of the left and right
sub-trees.

The functions with names of the form \"avl-tree--\" are intended for
internal use only.")

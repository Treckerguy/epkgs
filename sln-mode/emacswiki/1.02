 :commentary "\
This is an add-on library for project-buffer-mode

This library provides a function to create a project-buffer
extracting the project information from a SLN file.

To install it: just add the following lines to your init file:
  (autoload 'find-sln \"sln-mode\")

find-sln is the command to execute to open a 'sln project'.

Then check the project-buffer-mode for more documentation about
this mode.


Note about the build/clean/run/debug actions:

The command line are different between a 2005 and a 2008 project;
by default it will use the 2005 configuration mode; use the prefix
argument to switch to the 2008 mode.

-------

Extra note: 

It doesn't currently support modifying the SLN file. It's currently
just a 'viewer'.  Note that it doens't have to stay that way if
people really need this feature. ;-)

However it is possible to save the project as project-buffer
project files and reload it from there.

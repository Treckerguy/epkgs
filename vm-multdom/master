 :commentary "\
This file contains enhancements to VM for processing mail from multiple
domains that is forwarded to one site.  Specifically, it looks for the
address the sender used to send you mail, and sets your `From' (and
optionally, `Reply-To') header to use the same address in replies.

To use this package, put the following in your .emacs or .vm file:

   (require 'vm-multdom)
   (vm-multdom-install)
   (setq vm-multdom-user-addresses
         '(\"regexps\" \"matching\" \"each\" \"of\" \"your\" \"email\" \"addresses\"))

You may want to use regexps which match addresses for mail to specific
machines, e.g. \"\\\\(?:noahf?\\\\|friedman\\\\)@\\\\(?:.*\\\\.\\\\|\\\\)splode\\\\.com\".
See the fmailutils.el `fmailutils-make-address-regexp' function.

This package requires Emacs/XEmacs 19 or later, VM version 6.30 or
later, and fmailutils 1.10 or later.")

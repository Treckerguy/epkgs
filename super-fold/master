 :commentary "\
Super folding makes possible to selectively hide portions of the buffer. It
 allows to fold a region,  a function or a block
 included in commented delimiters.

TODOs and known bugs:
* when super-fold-defun is invoked from outside a function, it folds the 
  function right before the point. Don't really know if this is a bug or not...

* unfolding of single folded block needs to have point in a precise position. 
  Possible positions are two, though...

* need a customizer interface

* need a function to fold comments. that should be easy in C-like comment blocks,
  but in single line comment blocks (as lisp,e.g.), it should fold all commented
  lines of a block as a single fold.

* need a \"fold-dwim\" function to do what i mean about folding at point (e.g., if 
  on a fold, unfold; if between delims, fold-delims, if a region is selected, fold
  region, and so on).")

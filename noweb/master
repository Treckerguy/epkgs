 :commentary "\
A sort of major mode for the noweb literate programming system.
noweb files contain documentation regions which should be edited in
a major mode `noweb-doc-mode' and code regions which should be
edited in major mode `noweb-code-mode'.  These are separated by
marker regions which are edited in a separate `noweb-mode'.  (It's
arguable whether this is better than treating the marker as the
same mode as its following `chunk', but may cause less disturbance,
even with font-lock and `parse-sexp-lookup-properties' in force.)
The code and doc modes can be customized globally or set in file
local variables, e.g.:

Local variables:
mode: noweb
noweb-code-mode: c-mode
noweb-doc-mode: nroff-mode
End:

This is mostly compatible command- and keymap-wise with Thorsten
Ohl's old noweb-mode.el.  It is based on my multi-mode.el, and
inherits issues that has, especially in Emacs < 21.4.

Inter-chunk Outline and Imenu support is provided only in the noweb
buffer, i.e. when point is in a chunk header.  This could probably
be improved.

Perhaps needs commands for weaving and tangling the buffer rather
than relying on make.  Could use dealing with gerd's
<<name -*-mode-*->> notation for multiple code modes.")

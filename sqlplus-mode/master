 :commentary "\
This file is implements a simple SQL mode for emacs.  It knows how
 to talk to SQL*Plus via SQL*Net.  This mode was cobbled together
 and cut down by Martin Schwenke from the two sql-modes written by
 Rob Riepel and Peter D. Pezaris.  Rob Riepel's mode was hacked up
 version of Lynn Slater's sql.el, and some of his comments were
 pinched from Jim Lange's sqlplus , and probably still survive.
 Most of these modes are available from the elisp archives, if it
 still exists!

 sqlplus-mode is for editing and testing SQL statements in a
 standard text buffer.  The most useful feature of sqlplus-mode is
 sending SQL statements to an SQL*Plus interpreter. Font locking is
 also implemented.

 The following commands can be added to a global initialization
 file or to any user's .emacs file to conveniently use sqlplus-mode.

   (autoload 'sqlplus \"sqlplus-mode\"
     \"Start the interactive SQL*Plus interpreter in a new buffer.\" t)

   (autoload 'sqlplus-mode \"sqlplus-mode\"
     \"Mode for editing SQL files and running a SQL*Plus interpretor.\" t)

   (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.sql\\\\'\" . sqlplus-mode))

 Use describe-mode while in sqlplus-mode for further instructions.")

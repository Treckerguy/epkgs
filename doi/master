Do Or Insert

In Emacs, have some mode mix `read-only' and `edit' area,
So you need you DO command to with `read-only' area,
insert in `edit' area.

This this extension is make one keystroke DO OR INSERT in different
area automatically.

The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name \"~/elisp\"))

And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.

(require 'doi)

No need more.")

What is ``mouse-copy.el''?

It provides one-click text copy and move.  Rather than the
standard stroke-out-a-region (down-mouse-1, up-mouse-1) followed
by a yank (down-mouse-2, up-mouse-2 or C-y), you can now stroke
out a region and have it automatically pasted at the current
point.  You can also move text just as easily.  Although the
difference may not sound like much, it does make mousing text
around a lot easier, IMHO.

If you like mouse-copy, you should also check out mouse-drag
for ``one-click scrolling''.

To use mouse-copy, place the following in your .emacs file:
	(require 'mouse-copy)
    (global-set-key [M-down-mouse-1] 'mouse-drag-secondary-pasting)
    (global-set-key [M-S-down-mouse-1] 'mouse-drag-secondary-moving)

(These definitions override the old binding of M-mouse-1 to
mouse-drag-secondary.  I find I don't use that command much so its
loss is not important, and it can be made up with a M-mouse-1
followed by a M-mouse-3.  I personally reserve M-mouse bindings
for my window manager and bind everything to C-mouse.)


History and related work:

One-click copying and moving was inspired by lemacs-19.8.
Throw-scrolling was inspired by MacPaint's ``hand'' and by Tk's
mouse-2 scrolling.  The package mouse-scroll.el by Tom Wurgler
<twurgler@goodyear.com> is similar to mouse-drag-throw, but
doesn't pass clicks through.

These functions have been tested in emacs version 19.30,
and this package has run in the past on 19.25-19.29.

Originally mouse-copy was part of a larger package.
As of 11 July 96 the scrolling functions were split out
in preparation for incorporation into (the future) emacs-19.32.


Known Bugs:

- Highlighting is sub-optimal under 19.29 and XFree86-3.1.1
  (see \\\\[mouse-copy-work-around-drag-bug] for details).
- mouse-drag-secondary-pasting and mouse-drag-secondary-moving
  require X11R5 (or better) and so fail under older versions
  of Open Windows (like that present in Solaris/x86 2.1).


Future plans:

I read about the chording features of Plan-9's Acme environment at
<http://www.zip.com.au/~cs/app/wily/auug.html>.  I'd like
to incorporate some of these ideas into mouse-copy.  The only
lose is that this is not the current Emacs Way Of Doing Things, so
there would be a learning curve for existing emacs users.

Tom Wurgler <twurgler@goodyear.com> for reporting bugs and
suggesting fixes, and to Joel Graber <jgraber@ti.com> for
prompting me to do drag-scrolling and for an initial
implementation of horizontal drag-scrolling.

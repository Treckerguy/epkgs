ECB stands for \"Emacs Code Browser\" and is a source-code-browser for
(X)Emacs. It is a global minor-mode which offers a language-independent and
complete IDE (Integrated Development Environment) within one Emacs-frame.
It displays a couple of windows that can be used to browse directories,
files and file-contents like methods and variables. It supports source-code
parsing for semantic-supported languages like Java, C, C++, Elisp and
Scheme as well as for source-types supported \"only\" by imenu or etags (e.g.
perl, TeX, LaTeX etc.). In addition it offers (optional) a durable
\"compile-window\" at the bottom of the frame which is used to display all
help-, grep-, compile- and etc.-output. The rest of the frame is called the
\"edit-area\" which can be divided in several (no limit) edit-windows which
are used for editing of sources. Deleting some of the edit-windows does
neither destroy the compile-window nor the browsing-windows.

Here is an ascii-screenshot of what ECB offers you:

This is only one example-layout - ECB offers a lot of different layouts.

Installation

To use the Emacs code browser add the ECB files to your load path and add the
following line to your .emacs file:

If you want autoloading ECB after first start:

   (require 'ecb-autoloads)

or if you want loading the complete ECB:

   (require 'ecb)

Optional: You can byte-compile ECB with `ecb-byte-compile' after the
          ECB-package is loaded


Requirements

- Semantic, author-version between 1.4 and 1.4.9
  (http://cedet.sourceforge.net/semantic.shtml).
- Eieio, author-version between 0.17 and 0.17.9
  (http://cedet.sourceforge.net/eieio.shtml).
- speedbar, author version 0.14beta1 or higher
  (http://cedet.sourceforge.net/speedbar.shtml)
- Optional: If Java code is edited the ECB works best when the JDEE package
  (http://sunsite.auc.dk/jde) is installed.


Activation

ECB is either activated and started by calling
   M-x ecb-activate
or
   via the menu \"Tools --> Start Code Browser (ECB)\"

ECB can also be (de)activated/toggled by M-x ecb-minor-mode.

After activating ECB you should call `ecb-show-help' to get a detailed
description of what ECB offers to you and how to use ECB.


Availability

The latest version of the ECB is available at http://ecb.sourceforge.net

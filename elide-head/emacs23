Functionality for eliding boilerplate text (normally copyright
notices) in file headers to avoid clutter when you know what it
says.

`elide-head-headers-to-hide' controls what is elided by the command
`elide-head'.  A buffer-local invisible overlay manages the
elision.

You might add `elide-head' to appropriate major mode hooks or to
`find-file-hook'.  Please do not do this in site init files.  If
you do, information may be hidden from users who don't know it
already.

Note that `hs-minor-mode' will do a similar job by default, but
it's not selective about what leading commentary it hides.

Inspired by jwz's hide-copyleft.el, for which we don't have an
assignment.")

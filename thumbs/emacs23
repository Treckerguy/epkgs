This package create two new modes: thumbs-mode and thumbs-view-image-mode.
It is used for basic browsing and viewing of images from within Emacs.
Minimal image manipulation functions are also available via external
programs.  If you want to do more complex tasks like categorise and tag
your images, use image-dired.el

The 'convert' program from 'ImageMagick'
[URL:http://www.imagemagick.org/] is required.

Thanks: Alex Schroeder <alex@gnu.org> for maintaining the package at some
        time.  The peoples at #emacs@freenode.net for numerous help.  RMS
        for emacs and the GNU project.


CHANGELOG

This is version 2.0

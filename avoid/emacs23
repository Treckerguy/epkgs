 :commentary "\
For those who are annoyed by the mouse pointer obscuring text,
this mode moves the mouse pointer - either just a little out of
the way, or all the way to the corner of the frame.
To use, load or evaluate this file and type M-x mouse-avoidance-mode .
To set up permanently, put the following in your .emacs:

(if (display-mouse-p) (mouse-avoidance-mode 'animate))

Other legitimate alternatives include
`banish', `exile', `jump', `cat-and-mouse', and `proteus'.
They do somewhat different things.
See the documentation for function `mouse-avoidance-mode' for
details of the different modes.

For added silliness, make the animatee animate...
put something similar to the following into your .emacs:

(if (eq window-system 'x)
    (mouse-avoidance-set-pointer-shape
	     (eval (nth (random 4)
			'(x-pointer-man x-pointer-spider
			  x-pointer-gobbler x-pointer-gumby)))))

For completely random pointer shape, replace the setq above with:
(setq x-pointer-shape (mouse-avoidance-random-shape))

Bugs / Warnings / To-Do:

- Using this code does slow Emacs down.  \"banish\" mode shouldn't
  be too bad, and on my workstation even \"animate\" is reasonable.

- It ought to find out where any overlapping frames are and avoid them,
  rather than always raising the frame.

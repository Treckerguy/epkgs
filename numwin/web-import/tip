This library extends window-number.el
<http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/NumberedWindows> to turn window
numbering off and on only as needed.  It replaces `other-window'
with a function that prompts for a window number only when there
are more than two windows.  It replaces `delete-window',
`delete-other-windows', `split-window-horizontally', and
`split-window-vertically' with functions that, when called with an
argument, prompt for a target window by number.")

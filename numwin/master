 :commentary "\
Rather than take the long way around with `other-window', I found
myself reaching for the mouse whenever I had more than three
windows at a time. I tried some libraries that had the right
idea--switching windows by number--but did it wrong, indexing each
window with a number bound to a key sequence. The right way to do
it is:

 Show numbers only when it make sense. When switching windows, for
 example, only number for more than two.

 Instead of inventing new bindings, remap old ones. Selecting
 windows should use `C-x o' (or whatever `other-window' was bound
 to).

 Put numbers at the extreme left of the mode line (where they are
 always visible).

 Always number the selected window 0, so you know where you are.

Then I took the same idea and applied it to everything to do with
windows: deleting, splitting (vertically and horizontally),
\"zooming\" (with `delete-other-windows'), growing, shrinking, and
swapping windows, and displaying buffers and files in them.")

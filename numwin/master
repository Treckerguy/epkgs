Switching windows in Emacs, without the mouse, is awkward, because
you have to follow the cyclic ordering of windows - go in circles.
There are some libraries that make switching windows easier by
indexing each window to a number bound to a key sequence.

But if window numbering is a good thing, why not use it everywhere?
Deleting, splitting (vertically and horizontally), zooming (with
`delete-other-windows'), growing, shrinking, and swapping windows,
and displaying buffers and files in them, can all be simplified
with window numbering.

Numwin remaps the window commands, then remains invisible until
window numbering makes sense, which depends on the command. When
there are only two windows, for example, `numwin-other' just calls
`other-window'. But whenever there are multiple windows,
`numwin-vsplit' asks which window to split.

Numwin numbers on demand, and it re-numbers the windows every time,
so the number of the selected window (or the active minibuffer) is
always 0. Thus, to operate on the selected window you can rely on
muscle memory - without checking the screen - which keeps the
affordances of Numwin the same as those of stock Emacs, modulo one
extra keystroke (which doesn't even have to be 0: it can be SPC or
RET, anything but a number).")

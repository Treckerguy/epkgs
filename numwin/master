 :commentary "\
Since they have to be cycled through, managing more than three
windows at a time, without resorting to the mouse, is painful; and
resorting to the mouse is, for any self-respecting Emacs user, an
admission of defeat. There are a number of libraries extant that
work around this problem by assigning numbers to windows and
reserving a key sequence for each. Very good; but a permanent
number for each window means never being sure which window you are
in; and new keybindings are always undesirable. Numwin does
neither. It displays numbers only when they make sense for a
particular operation: for switching windows, say, numbering them
only makes sense if there are more than two. It prints numbers,
sensibly, at the far left of the modeline---the only position that
is visible no matter the window layout---and it always numbers the
selected window 0. This more general approach works not just for
switching windows, but also works for deleting, splitting
(vertically or horizontally), \"zooming\" (with
`delete-other-windows'), growing, shrinking, and swapping windows,
and displaying buffers and files in them.")

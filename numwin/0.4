Switching windows in Emacs, without the mouse, is awkward, because
you have to follow the cyclic ordering of windows - go in circles.
There are some libraries that make life easier by indexing each
window to a number bound to a key sequence.

If numbering is a good thing, let's use it everywhere. Deleting,
splitting (vertically and horizontally), zooming (with
`delete-other-windows'), growing, shrinking, and swapping windows,
and displaying buffers and files in them, can all be simplified
with numbering.

Numwin remaps the window commands, then remains invisible until
window numbering makes sense. The behavior depends on the command.
When there are only two windows, for example, `numwin-other' just")

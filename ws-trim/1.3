 :commentary "\
This package contains tools to do various sorts of whitespace
trimming on buffer lines.  The main part is WS Trim mode, which is
a minor mode that automatically trims whitespace on text lines.
You can control how thorough this mode should be, e.g. whether all
lines or only lines you edit should be trimmed.  For further
reading see the document strings for the variables `ws-trim-mode'
and `ws-trim-level'.

To install the package, either issue \"(require 'ws-trim)\" in a good
place (i.e. your .emacs file), or autoload some of the functions
below.  You can activate WS Trim mode for a specific buffer by
calling `turn-on-ws-trim'.

There is also a Global WS Trim mode that automagically turns on WS
Trim mode in most buffers.  Put \"(global-ws-trim-mode t)\" in your
.emacs to use it.  By default a heuristic is used to determine if
WS Trim mode should be on or off in every buffer.  You can control
this through the variable `ws-trim-global-modes'.

This package has been tested with GNU Emacs version 19.34 and 20.7.
It won't run in versions older than 19.23.  Versions in between are
currently untested.  Reported to work with XEmacs 19.14.

Comments, suggestions and bug reports are always welcome.

This package aimed to bring popup menus to be more usable for
keyboard friendly and mouse unfriendly people like me.  On the one
hand I like popup menus, because they just perfect and easy
interface for selective task, but on the other hand I hate them,
because I need to find my trackball, click ugly buttons, twiddle
ball to access menu item.  This pretty annoys.  Also popup menus
are not available in console.  tpum.el package makes popup menu
inlined in buffer, or creates transient XEmacs frame with temporary
buffer, where menu will be inlined.  So this makes possible to
control popup menus using keyboard and makes possible to popup
menus in console.  To start using tpum.el just include in your
~/.emacs next:

To enable tpum globally:

   (require 'tpum)
   (tpum-global-mode 1)

Or if you don't want tpum to be enable globally (default) do
something like:

   (autoload 'tpum-minor-mode \"Toggle tpum minor mode.\" t)

 And then enable tpum minor mode by `M-x tpum-minor-mode RET'.

Customization:

To change tpum styles use:

   (setq tpum-cstyle 'tpum-style-pseudo)
   (setq tpum-menu-type 'inline)

Best menu redering done if you are using fixed width fonts with
pseudo-graphic characters and 'tpum-style-pseudo as tpum style.")

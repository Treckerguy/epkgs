This file makes the active region be pending delete, meaning that
text inserted while the region is active will replace the region contents.
This is a popular behavior of personal computers text editors.

Interface:

Commands which will delete the selection need a 'delete-selection
property on their symbols; commands which insert text but don't
have this property won't delete the selection.  It can be one of
the values:
 'yank
     For commands which do a yank; ensures the region about to be
     deleted isn't yanked.
 'supersede
     Delete the active region and ignore the current command,
     i.e. the command will just delete the region.
 'kill
     `kill-region' is used on the selection, rather than
     `delete-region'.  (Text selected with the mouse will typically
     be yankable anyhow.)
 non-nil
     The normal case: delete the active region prior to executing
     the command which will insert replacement text.")

Provides a global minor mode (toggled by M-x hl-line-mode) to
highlight, in a windowing system, the line on which point is
(except in a minibuffer window) to satisfy a request for a feature
of Lesser Editors.

You probably don't really want this; if the cursor is difficult to
spot, try changing its colour or using a cursor blinking
<URL:http://www.wonderworks.com/download/blinking-cursor.el.gz> or
jiggling <URL:http://www.eskimo.com/%7Eseldon> package.  The
hookery involved might slow Emacs significantly on a slow machine.

An overlay is used, active only on the selected window.  Hooks are
added to `pre-command-hook' and `post-command-hook' to activate and
deactivate (by making it 'highlight zero width) the overlay.
`hl-line-unhighlight', on `pre-command-hook', deactivates it
unconditionally in case the command changes the selected window
(rather than keeping track of changes in the selected window).
`hl-line-highlight', on `post-command-hook', activates it again
across the window width.")

Use the commands defined here to examine or save the background or
 foreground color at the text cursor or the mouse pointer.

 After using commands `eyedrop-pick-background-*' or
 `eyedrop-pick-foreground-*', the picked color is saved in variable
 `eyedrop-picked-background' or `eyedrop-picked-foreground',
 respectively.

 If you have Emacs 22 or later, all of the functionality provided
 here, and much more, is provided in library `palette.el'.  Use
 library `eyedropper' instead of `palette.el' if you do not want to
 use the color palette or if your Emacs version is older than Emacs
 22.  If you load `palette.el', there is no reason to also load
 `eyedropper.el'.  However, if for some reason you do load both
 `palette.el' and `eyedropper.el', load `palette.el' second, so
 that its definitions will override those provided here, providing
 additional functionality for the color palette.

 To use this library:

   Add this to your initialization file (~/.emacs or ~/_emacs):

     (require 'eyedropper) ; Load this library.

   You will also need my library `hexrgb.el'; it is loaded
   automatically by `eyedropper.el'.  Get it here:
   http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/hexrgb.el.

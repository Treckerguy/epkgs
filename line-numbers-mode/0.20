 :commentary "\
This package implements a minor mode for XEmacs which, when enabled,
will display the line number on each line on current window. Note that
this is different from another similarly-named minor-mode line-number-mode
which only displays the current line number at the point on modeline.
The numbers are displayed as annotations, they are not part of actual text.

To use it,
1. byte-compile the elisp file
2. add this line to your .emacs file:  (require 'line-numbers-mode)
3. use the minor-mode-menu on modeline or M-x line-numbers-mode to toggle
   3a. if you like to turn this minor mode on for every file you open, then
       add this line to your .emacs file:
       (add-hook 'find-file-hook 'line-numbers-mode)
   3b. if you like to turn this minor mode on for certain major-mode files,
       say cperl-mode, then add a mode hook:
       (add-hook 'cperl-mode-hook 'line-numbers-mode)

Caveats/Bugs:

This minor-mode was developed in XEmacs v21.0b60, and tested on XEmacs 20.4, 19.16 and 19.14
Since XEmacs-specific extents are used, it will not work for any version of FSF GNU Emacs.
Some line numbers may not show immediately after each command.")

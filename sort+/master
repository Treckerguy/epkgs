Extensions to `sort.el'.


 ***** NOTE: The following function defined in `sort.el' has been
             REDEFINED HERE:

 `sort-reorder-buffer' - This version preserves text properties,
                         even in Emacs versions prior to 20.


 This file should be loaded after loading the standard GNU file
 `sort.el'.  So, in your `~/.emacs' file, do this:
 (eval-after-load \"sort\" '(require 'sort+))")

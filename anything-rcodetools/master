 :commentary "\
(0) You need rcodetools, anything.el and FastRI. Note that you do not have to
    configure anything.el if you use anything.el for this package.
(1) You need to add to .emacs:
      (require 'anything)
      (require 'anything-rcodetools)
      ;; Command to get all RI entries.
      (setq rct-get-all-methods-command \"PAGER=cat fri -l\")
      ;; See docs
      (define-key anything-map \"\\C-z\" 'anything-execute-persistent-action)")

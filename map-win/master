 :commentary "\
This is pretty much equivalent to the `walk-windows' function in Emacs
19, but the macro is \"cleaner\" since it avoids creating local variables
whose names could interfere with the dynamic scope of the caller.  It
also allows the frames argument to specify a particular frame object to
traverse.")

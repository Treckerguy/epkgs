 :commentary "\
This package provides the `view' minor mode documented in the Emacs
user's manual.
View mode entry and exit is done through the functions view-mode-enter
and view-mode-exit.  Use these functions to enter or exit view-mode from
emacs lisp programs.
We use both view- and View- as prefix for symbols.  View- is used as
prefix for commands that have a key binding.  view- is used for commands
without key binding.  The purpose of this is to make it easier for a
user to use command name completion.

Suggested key bindings:

(define-key ctl-x-4-map \"v\" 'view-file-other-window)  ; ^x4v
(define-key ctl-x-5-map \"v\" 'view-file-other-frame)  ; ^x5v

You could also bind view-file, view-buffer, view-buffer-other-window and
view-buffer-other-frame to keys.")

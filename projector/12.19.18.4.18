 :commentary "\
Projector.el implements the following features, which are the least
I expect, and the most I desire, from any implementation of the
concept of a project.

- Practical for large projects containing thousands of files.
- Generate and update a tags file automatically.
- Never wait for tags-completion-table to refresh.
- Tags commands act on only one project at a time.
- Replace a killed buffer with another buffers in the same project.
  (This sound trivial, but one you are used to it is sine qua non.)
- Support remote and read-only projects.
- A single Dired buffer listing all project files (`projector-dired').
- Use Ido to navigate files, buffers, and tags.
- Cycle through project files (handy for macros).
- Sundry trivial commands: e.g., version control in project
  (`projector-vc'), grep in project (`projector-grep'), incremental
  search in project (`projector-isearch'), list buffers in project
  (`projector-list-buffers'), &c.

Call M-x apropos-projector for a full list of commands.

TODO
C-z C-q should set project read only.")

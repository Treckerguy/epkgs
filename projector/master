Short answer: projector variables + tags + Ido = Projector.

- Generates tags file for project and update it (in background)
  every time you save.
- Uses familiar Emacs features: project variables and tags tables.
- Provides project-scoped versions of most file, buffer, dir and tag commands.
- Parallel project commands using C-z prefix: i.e. C-z C-f for
  `projector-find-file', C-z b for `projector-switch-to-buffer-',
  &c.
- Maintain project as context by ensuring that killed buffers are
  replaced with other buffers belonged to the same project.
- Any project command can be limited to a subset of files filtering
  by wildcard, regexp, substring, mode, or predicate.
- ALlows remote projects.
- Allows read-only projects (handy for reading code).
- Ignore files by extension or regexp, globally or per-project.

handle multiple occasions of a single tag

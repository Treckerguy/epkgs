 :commentary "\
This package is inspired by the lightweight projects offered by
some modern text editors, but its purpose is to make it as easy to
navigate the code of any large project as Emacs makes navigating
its own code.

Usage:
(require 'projector)
(projector-mode 1)
(global-set-key (kbd \"C-.\") 'project-argument)

Try `M-x apropos-projector' for a full list of commands.

The first step in using Projector is to recognize a project.
Usually just visiting a file in the project is enough to recognize
it but, if not, do M-x `new-project'.

Projector is stateless: it never loads or configures a project,
just recognizes it. You don't even have to own the project, so it
can be read-only or remote. And even if you do own the project you
can still make Emacs pretend you don't using
`toggle-project-read-only', which is useful for reading or
reviewing code.

Once you have recognized a project Emacs will try to maintain the
context of that project. For example, when you kill a buffer, Emacs
will try to replace it with another buffer in the same project. You
can use M-. to jump to the definition of any symbol in the project.
You can get back where you started with M-*. If there is more than
one definition for a given symbol M-, will cycle through them. If
no tags table has been built yet, Projector will build it
automatically in the background; and you can contnue working in the
meantime.

Projector defines no keybindings of its own. Instead, by using
`project-argument', you tell Emacs to call the project equivalent
of an ordinary command. So, assuming stock keybindings, C-. C-s
does an incremental search in the project; C-. C-x d opens the
entire project for editing in a Dired buffer; and so forth.")

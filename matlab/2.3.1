 :commentary "\
This major mode for GNU Emacs provides support for editing MATLAB dot-m
files.  It automatically indents for block structures, line continuations
(e.g., ...), and comments.

Additional features include auto-fill including auto-additions of
ellipsis for commands, and even strings.  Block/end construct
highlighting as you edit.  Primitive code-verification and
identification.  Templates and other code editing functions.
Advanced symbol completion.  Code highlighting via font-lock.
There are many navigation commands that let you move across blocks
of code at different levels.

Lastly, there is support for running MATLAB in an Emacs buffer,
with full shell history and debugger support (when used with the db
commands.)  The shell can be used as an online help while editing
code, providing help on functions, variables, or running arbitrary
blocks of code from the buffer you are editing.

Finding Updates:

The latest stable version of matlab.el can be found on MATLAB Central:

Catagory:
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadCategory.do?objectId=19&objectType=Category
This File
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=104&objectType=file

Older versions of matlab.el can be found in as matlab.el.1.10.1
for emacsen that do not have the latest additional utilities such
as tempo and derived.

Installation:

Put the this file as \"matlab.el\" somewhere on your load path, then
add this to your .emacs or site-init.el file:

  (autoload 'matlab-mode \"matlab\" \"Enter MATLAB mode.\" t)
  (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '(\"\\\\.m\\\\'\" . matlab-mode) auto-mode-alist))
  (autoload 'matlab-shell \"matlab\" \"Interactive MATLAB mode.\" t)

User Level customizations (You need not use them all):
  (setq matlab-indent-function t)	; if you want function bodies indented
  (setq matlab-verify-on-save-flag nil) ; turn off auto-verify on save
  (defun my-matlab-mode-hook ()
    (setq fill-column 76))		; where auto-fill should wrap
  (add-hook 'matlab-mode-hook 'my-matlab-mode-hook)
  (defun my-matlab-shell-mode-hook ()
	'())
  (add-hook 'matlab-shell-mode-hook 'my-matlab-shell-mode-hook)

If you are using a version of MATLAB with the Desktop enabled,
you may need to add this:

  (setq matlab-shell-command-swithes '(\"-nojvm\"))

Please read the mode help for matlab-mode for additional
configuration options.

Syntax highlighting:
  To get font-lock try adding this for older emacsen:
    (font-lock-mode 1)
  Or for newer versions of Emacs:
    (global-font-lock-mode t)
  To get hilit19 support try adding:
    (matlab-mode-hilit)

This package requires easymenu, tempo, and derived.
This package will optionally use custom, shell, and gud.
This package supports language specific extensions in imenu, func-menu,
     speedbar, font-lock, and hilit19.

Mailing List:

A mailing list has been set up where beta versions of matlab.el are
posted, and where comments, questions, bug reports, and answers to
questions can be sent.

 :commentary "\
TACL stands for Tandem Advanced Command Language.

Keywords as of G06.10 are recognized. There are 3 types of keywords.
  #builtin functions, #builtin variables, option keywords.
  Option keywords are those that are only keywords when found between
  slash marks or vertical bars.

All keywords have abbrev table entries.  Use M-x list-abbrevs for a listing.
  Abbrevs are generated programatically from tacl-keywords-... to be the
  minimum number of characters to uniquely identify the keyword.

Bracket handling is managed by emacs show-paren-mode. I just turn it on.

imode recognizes both ?section and [#def ...] style definitions but only
  within the first 3 characters of a line.  This is intended to prevent
  large numbers of sub-definitions from making imenu huge/useless.  You can
  tweek this by altering tacl-imenu-expression-alist thru customize.

eldoc is supported although there is no automated way of generating the
actual help files. I'm sure it can be usefull all the same.  Search for
tacl-syntax.el for a sizable number of help entries to get you started.
Customize tacl-eldoc-def-files to include this file.
Once you have your help entries defined see help for eldoc-mode for
turing on the mode.  Putting (eldoc-mode t) in .emacs might do it.")

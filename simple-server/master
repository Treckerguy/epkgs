 :commentary "\
`simple-server' implements a very simple http server which will
hopefully be able to hand off GET requests to functions specified
in the `ss-dispatch-table'.

The `ss-dispatch-table' should contain a list of dispatch functions
each of which will be tried in turn and given a chance to return
either a handler or nil.  The dispatch functions will have access
to the`ss-request' variable through the following functions

- `ss-request-host' returns the host name of the request
- `ss-request-method' returns the method as a keyword i.e. :get
- `ss-request-uri' returns the path of the uri following the
   hostname and port etc...

handlers

A handler is a function which will be called with no arguments (but
does have access to the request functions mentioned above) and
should return a HTTP string which will be passed back to the
client.

Hopefully one day it will parse get parameters and handle post
requests.")

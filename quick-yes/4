This is a spot of code for Emacs 21 (and up) to bind M-y to answer \"yes\"
to a `yes-or-no-p' question.

Some `yes-or-no-p' questions can be disabled, but if you leave them
enabled as a reminder, or just in case it's important, then M-y is a good
shortcut for accepting.

If you start typing \"y\" or \"ye\", etc, you can still use M-y to finish it.
Typing \"y\" is easy to do if you don't immediately notice it's
`yes-or-no-p' instead of `y-or-n-p'.

quick-yes only affects a `yes-or-no-p' question in the minibuffer, it
doesn't change a window system dialog box (as used by `yes-or-no-p' when
the invoking action was a mouse button press instead of something from
the keyboard).")

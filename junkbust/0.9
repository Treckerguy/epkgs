Introduction:
  
  `junkbust.el' adds some features to Emacs for configuring the Internet
  Junkbuster Proxy(tm), aka Junkbuster, which is a GPL'd filtering HTTP
  proxy from Junkbusters Corp. (`http://www.junkbuster.com/ijb.html').
  Different people use Junkbuster for different reasons, including those of
  privacy, usability, aesthetics, and bandwidth.

  The three main features offered in this version of `junkbust.el' are:

  * Functions for adding new rules to the Junkbuster blocklist without
    having to manually edit the blocklist file.  The default URL is taken
    from the native selection service.  `junkbust.el' generates a pattern
    from a given URL, including special-case handling of URLs for
    Akamai-hosted objects.  The blocklist file is automatically checked out
    writable from VC if necessary.

    As of version 0.4, `junkbust.el' also generates more \"generalized\"
    versions of the blocklist pattern, which are accessible via the
    minibuffer history (usually invoked with M-p) when the user is prompted
    to edit the rule.  Currently, the generated generalizations are for
    numeric parts of the trailing part of the URL path (which the author
    often finds useful).  For example, if the original URL ends in
    `box1-27-3.jpg', the default rule would end in `box1-27-3\\\\.jpg', and
    the two alternative rules would end in `box1-27-[0-9]+\\\\.jpg' and
    `box[0-9]+-[0-9]+-[0-9]+\\\\.jpg'.

  * Fontifying of the Junkbuster blocklist.  This is helpful in reading the
    path regular expression, and in distinguishing the domain name and path
    parts of the rule patterns (which have different syntax).

  * Organizing of the blocklist file, with the `junkbust-blocklist-organize'
    function, sorting by positive/negative, domain name hierarchy (i.e., so
    that `doubleclick.net' rules appear near `www.doubleclick.net' ones),
    etc., and right-justifying the domain name patterns.  This organization
    is good for visualizing many opportunities to combine or generalize
    rules.

  These features can be invoked from within the Emacs UI, or you can use the
  special `gnuserv' support to invoke `junkbust' features from external
  processes (e.g., window manager menus and key bindings, Web browser
  menus).

  Note: \"Internet Junkbuster Proxy\" is a trademark of Junkbusters Corp.
        `junkbust.el' is some complementary Emacs Lisp code to help people
        use Junkbuster through Emacs.  `junkbust.el' is not part of
        Junkbuster, and is neither provided nor supported by Junkbusters
        Corp.

System Requirements:

  The `junkbust.el' package was written using FSF GNU Emacs 20.7 on a
  GNU/Linux system, and should work with recent Emacs versions on Unix
  variants.  `junkbust.el' is not officially supported by the author under
  Emacs running on non-Unixish platforms (but it'll probably work on those
  platforms after properly setting the `junkbust-blocklist-file'
  customization variable).

  `junkbust.el' was developed for use with Junkbuster 2.0.2, and was tested
  with Steven Waldherr's slightly-modified version, which was installed as
  an RPM (`http://www.waldherr.org/junkbuster/').  It should work with any
  recent Junkbuster version.

  The remote feature was tested with `gnuserv' 2.1alpha
  (`http://www-uk.hpl.hp.com/people/ange/gnuserv/') by Andy Norman.

Installation:

  1. Put this `junkbust.el' file somewhere in your Emacs Lisp load path.

  2. Add the following to your `.emacs' file (or elsewhere):

         (require 'junkbust)

  3. Use the Customize feature of Emacs to set various options of the
     Data->Junkbust group.  You should especially check to make sure that
     `junkbust-blocklist-file' is set correctly for your Junkbuster 
     installation.

  4. You may wish to bind global keys to some functions.  For example:

         (global-set-key   [f6] 'junkbust-block-url-edit-rule)
         (global-set-key [S-f6] 'junkbust-block-url-edit-url)
         (global-set-key [C-f6] 'junkbust-blocklist-file-visit)

  5. Make sure that you have write permission to the Junkbuster
     configuration files.  For example, if you installed Junkbuster as
     user `root' on a Unix box, and you normally run your Emacs as user
     `jlopez', you might do something like this:

         chown -R jlopez /etc/junkbuster
         chmod 0755 /etc/junkbuster
         chmod 0644 /etc/junkbuster/*

  6. Optionally, if you want to use `junkbust' features from remote
     processes via `gnuserv', you can use `gnudoit' to call the functions
     that begin with `junkbust-remote-' (which try to do the right thing
     about creating frame, focusing, etc.).  For example, if you're using
     the Fvwm2 window manager, you might wish to bind a key to invoke a menu
     such as:

   AddToMenu JunkbusterMenu \"Junkbuster\" Title
   + \"Block &Pattern\"  Exec gnudoit '(junkbust-remote-block-url-edit-rule)'
   + \"Block &Verbatim\" Exec gnudoit '(junkbust-remote-block-url-edit-url)'
   + \"&Edit Blocklist\" Exec gnudoit '(junkbust-remote-blocklist-file-visit)'

How To Use It:

  The most frequent use of `junkbust.el' might be to quickly add blocklist
  rules while you're browsing the Web, by copying the URL from the Web
  browser and invoking `junkbust-block-url-edit-url' or
  `junkbust-block-url-edit-rule'.  For example, if you see an image in Web
  page viewed in Netscape Navigator, you might right-click on the image,
  select \"Copy Image Location\" from the pop-up menu, select \"Block URL (edit
  Rule)\" from the Tools->Junkbuster menu, and press Return.

Author's To-Do List:

  * In `junkbust-block-url-prompt', strip leading whitespace, then limit it
    to one line.

  * Redo `junkbust-blocklist-font-lock-keywords', since they're all wrong.

  * Do metasequence fontifying in the domain name part of the blocklist
    rules.

  * Add more substantial function doc for `junkbust-blocklist-mode'.

  * Add a function to organize the blocklist file.

  * Support other Junkbuster config files.

  * Add a mode menu to `blocklist-mode'.

  * Add documentation about Netscape selection crash bug.

  * Improve code in `junkbust-remote-block-url-backend'.

  * Maybe warn on dangerous blocklist patterns such as `ad*.*.*'.

  * Add remote feature tailored to minibuffer frames.

  * Add remote feature that will let us get the URL from an environment
    variable, which would be useful with Larswm.

  * Fontify \"~\" in blocklist when there's no domain part.

  * Make programmatic blocklist rule insertion indent automatically.

  * Add indent function for interactive blocklist editing.

  * Make blocklist organizing sort IP address patterns numerically.

  * Remove duplicate blocklist rules when organizing.")

 :commentary "\
Iread is Isearch without the search---a utility for acting
incrementally on user input.  It is implemented as a minor mode,
with a number of normal and abnormal hooks.  But all the moving
parts are encased by the macro `defiread', which lets you build up
incremental behavior by passing keyword arguments.")

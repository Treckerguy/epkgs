This package emulates the mark, copy, cut and paste look-and-feel of motif
programs (which is the same as the MAC gui and (sorry for that) MS-Windows).
It modifies the keybindings of the cursor keys and the next, prior,
home and end keys. They will modify mark-active.
You can still get the old behavior of cursor moving with the
control sequences C-f, C-b, etc.
This package uses transient-mark-mode and
delete-selection-mode.

In addition to that all key-bindings from the pc-mode are
done here too (as suggested by RMS).

As I found out after I finished the first version, s-region.el tries
to do the same.... But my code is a little more complete and using
delete-selection-mode is very important for the look-and-feel.
Pete Forman <pete.forman@airgun.wg.waii.com> provided some motif
compliant keybindings which I added. I had to modify them a little
to add the -mark and -nomark functionality of cursor moving.

Many thanks to all who made comments.
Thanks to RMS and Ralf Muschall <prm@rz.uni-jena.de> for criticism.
Kevin Cutts <cutts@ukraine.corp.mot.com> added the beginning-of-buffer
and end-of-buffer functions which I modified a little.
David Biesack <sasdjb@unx.sas.com> suggested some more cleanup.
Thanks to Pete Forman <pete.forman@airgun.wg.waii.com>
for additional motif keybindings.
Thanks to jvromans@squirrel.nl (Johan Vromans) for a bug report
concerning setting of this-command.
Dan Nicolaescu <done@ece.arizona.ro> suggested suppressing the
scroll-up/scroll-down error.
Eli Barzilay (eli@cs.bgu.ac.il) suggested the sexps functions and
keybindings.

Ok, some details about the idea of PC Selection mode:

 o The standard keys for moving around (right, left, up, down, home, end,
   prior, next, called \"move-keys\" from now on) will always de-activate
   the mark.
 o If you press \"Shift\" together with the \"move-keys\", the region
   you pass along is activated
 o You have the copy, cut and paste functions (as in many other programs)
   which will operate on the active region
   It was not possible to bind them to C-v, C-x and C-c for obvious
   emacs reasons.
   They will be bound according to the \"old\" behavior to S-delete (cut),
   S-insert (paste) and C-insert (copy). These keys do the same in many
   other programs.")

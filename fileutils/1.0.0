 :commentary "\
This package provides a set of emulated UNIX commands which are provided by
almost all POSIX compliant Operating Systems.  The real commands are not
executed themselves, this is all done through ELisp.  All of the commands
provided here are interactive.

Note that in order to correctly emulate these commands there is no command
prefix and since these have short names (md, ls, mv, etc) they could conflict
with future Emacs lisp functions.")

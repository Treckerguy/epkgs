This file is intended for use with Markus Kuhn's Unicode fonts,
see <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html>, and the
Otfried Cheong's extension of Mule-UCS, available at
<http://www.cs.uu.nl/~otfried/Mule/>.

The idea is to provide a routine way to input the many TeX
characters (and some more) using the familiar TeX notation.  Surely
it is not convenient for typing a French or German text, for which
there are special packages; but I prefer to use it for a mixed
text, where some accented characters from various languages occur
sporadically, and it is better to type a longer key sequence
/\"Arger for Ärger rather than suffer from unexpected äny\" when
typing \"any\" (as it is usual with the shorter `\"Arger' manner, or
with o'clock becoming oćlock etc).

I've taken some liberties with the TeX notation:
1. Backslash is replaced with solidus in its escape function.  The
   reason is obvious: TeX users heavily use backspace for many other
   purposes as well.
2. The prefix \"text\" is systematically dropped; just /euro rather
   than /texteuro, /perthousand rather than \\textperthousand.
3. No internal spaces, e.g. /cC rather than {/c C} or /c{C}.
4. /! and /? are used instead of !` and ?` -- like in EuroTeX,
   just to reduce the number of escape characters.
5. /3/4 etc is used instead of \\textthreequarters.
6. If HTML offers a ahorter Latin-1 name, it is preferred:
   /reg rather than \\textregistered, /nbsp rather than \\nobreakspace,
   /copy rather than \\copyright etc. (Such abbreviations are marked
   with \"HTML\" in a comment field.)

Installation:

Save this file as quail/u8tex.el (the \"quail\" may be your
emacs/20.*/leim/quail or a directory on your load-path), byte
compile it and put a record like this:

(register-input-method
 \"u8tex\" \"utf-8\" 'quail-use-package
 \"τεχ\" \"Unicode input using (Euro)TeX names\"
 \"quail/u8tex\")

into emacs/20.*/leim/leim-list.el (probably there exists a more
civilized way to extend leim-list?).  Then (after reloading Mule)
you can switch to u8tex in the usual way (`C-x C-m C-\\ u8tex'; the
first u... is sufficient for completion in my environment).

Changes in v. 1.2:
1. Documentation (reference to Otfried's package).
2. Some HTML abbreviations are adopted (/copy, /reg etc).
3. Errors corrected: /permil
4. More amssymb characters.")

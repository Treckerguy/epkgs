 ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `replace.el' have
             been REDEFINED HERE:

   `flush-lines' - (Not needed for Emacs 21)
                   1. The prompt has been changed, to mention that
                      only lines after point are affected.
                   2. The default regexp is provided by
                      `search/replace-default-fn'.
                   3. An in-progress message has been added.
   `how-many' - (Not needed for Emacs 21)
                1. Prompt changed: lines after point are affected.
                2. Default regexp: `search/replace-default-fn'.
                3. An in-progress message has been added.
   `keep-lines' - Same as `flush-lines'. (Not needed for Emacs 21)
   `occur' - 1. Default regexp is from `search/replace-default-fn'.
             2. Regexp is saved as `occur-regexp' for use by
                `occur-mode-mouse-goto'
   `occur-mode-goto-occurrence', `occur-mode-display-occurrence', 
   `occur-mode-goto-occurrence-other-window',
   `occur-mode-mouse-goto' - Highlights regexp in source buffer
                             and visited linenum in occur buffer.
   `occur-read-primary-args' - (Emacs 21 only) Default regexps via
                               `search/replace-default-fn'.
   `query-replace-read-args',  - (Not needed for Emacs 21)
                               1. Uses `completing-read' if
                                  `replace-w-completion-flag' is
                                  non-nil.
                               2. Default regexps are obtained via
                                  `search/replace-default-fn'.
   `query-replace-read-(from|to)' - Same as `query-replace-read-args',
                                    but for Emacs 21.


 This file should be loaded after loading the standard GNU file
 `replace.el'.  So, in your `~/.emacs' file, do this:
 (eval-after-load \"replace\" '(progn (require 'replace+)))

 Because standard variables such as `list-matching-lines-face' are
 predefined, this file overrides the standard definition.  If you
 want a different value, you must set it after loading this file.

 For Emacs releases prior to Emacs 22, these Emacs 22 key bindings
 are made here:

  (define-key occur-mode-map \"o\" 'occur-mode-goto-occurrence-other-window)
  (define-key occur-mode-map \"\\C-o\" 'occur-mode-display-occurrence))

 Suggested additional key binding:

  (substitute-key-definition 'query-replace 'query-replace-w-options
                             global-map)")

Emsane is an Emancs frontend for SANE.  Emsane runs scanadf with
various jobs, to make it easy to scan books, magazines etc.

SANE is an acronym for \"scanner acces now easy\", scanner support
available for free operating systems, see
http://www.sane-project.org/

Some interesting Emsane features:
- convenient Emacs interface to scanning
- handles one or several scanners
- use different scanner settings for different sections of a book
- the power of tramp lets you run scanners remotely over ssh
- dired your scans
- postprocess scans:
  - format conversions, to djvu for instance
  - unpaper
- multi-scanner mode, scan different sections of a book with different scanners to speed up scanning

Quick usage:
- Define scanners and jobs in a file, \"emsane-config.el\"
for instance. See sample.
- load \"emsane\" and \"emsane-config\"
- start scanning with \"emsane-scan-start
- check out the keybindings, but mostly you use \"return\" and \"n\" while scanning.

Some Emsane concepts:
scanner - a set of options describing a scanner
section - a list of scanner and postprocessing settings
job  - a list of sections

A section definition can contain:
- paper size; expressed as an alias(ISO sizes or common book sizes), or width x height
- front or duplex scan
- color/lineart
- resolution
- file name pattern
- postprocessing options

emsane.el is complemented by other Emacs packages such as dired,
and some of my own packages such as dired-sequence.el, and a patch
to the Emacs core to optionaly use imagemagick for image display,
so djvu files can be shown in Emacs.")

 :commentary "\
Defines a function `vimvars-obey-vim-modeline' which is suitable for
a hook which checks for a VI-style in the current buffer and sets
various Emacs buffer-local variables accordingly.


FIXME: update this to be more consistent with VIM, which by checks 
default checks the first 5 lines.")

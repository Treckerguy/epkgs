 :commentary "\
This is a minor mode for people who uses numbers as prefixes more often than
to insert them in text. With this minor mode entering a number is roughly
equivalent to entering C-u <number>.

Examples: Entering \"3\" will not insert 3 in the text but rather wait for the
next key. The echo area will show \"3\" so you know what you are doing. If you
then enter \"1\" the echo area will show \"31\". Entering <SPC> at this point
will insert the number 31 at point in the buffer (but no space), but if you
enter any other key sequence, such as \"C-f\" or \"p\" it will be repeated 31
times. Thus \"31<SPC>\" yields \"31\", and \"31p\" yields
\"ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp\".")

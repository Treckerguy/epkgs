This mode is for editing '/etc/apt/sources.list', the APT (Advanced
Package Tool) configuration file found on Debian systems.

APT is a package retrieval tool for Debian (a GNU distribution, see
http://www.debian.org); for example you could install Emacs with
the command:

  apt-get install emacs21

and APT will then retrieve the package and install it for you. The
sources.list file tells APT where to look for packages. Mine looks
like this:

  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian unstable main contrib
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US unstable/non-US main

  deb ftp://ftp.de.debian.org/debian ../project/experimental main

This mode font-locks the file and add some things including new
source lines and modifying existing source lines.

This mode can be customized in diferent parts. You can (interactively)
change if you want blank lines around a new source line and comment
with `apt-sources-around-lines'. Also you can change the way that
this mode names each source line, with variable`apt-sources-source-name';
if no name is entered, no commente name will be inserted.
To customize, try `M-x customize-group [RET] apt-sources'

You can modify existing parts of the source line; check the mode
documentation for mor details. Another thing that this mode can do is to
replicate an existing line (`C-c C-r') that will be changed to the 'deb' or
'deb-src' corresponding line. If it replicates a 'deb' line, an identical
'deb-src' source line will be created.

To load this mode, you can add a \"Local Variables\" block at the end of
the sources.list file with `C-c C-v' after you change the file's mode to
'apt-sources'.  But this should not be needed since an entry is added to
`auto-mode-alist' to automatically enter this mode when editing files
named `sources.list'.

You can always find the latest version of this mode on
'http://people.gnulinux.org.mx/drs/emacs/apt-sources.el'")

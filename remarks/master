*** Usage

Installation: Put (require 'remarks) (remarks-install) into your
startup/user init file.

Select a region and execute `remarks-make'. Remarks are saved and
restored via =file-properties.el=.

- Exit the note editing buffer by pressing C-c C-c -- if you kill the
temporary buffer otherwise, the editing modes could get messed up.

- Make the first line a meaningful title.

- Inserting a null-text results in the deletion of the note.

- When notes overlap, the user will be asked to select one note by its
title.

- Usually remarks will be saved when killing the buffer. You can
nevertheless force saving notes by calling `file-properties-write'.

- When closing a buffer, opened remarks will be saved automatically.

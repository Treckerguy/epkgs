 :commentary "\
`wcount-mode' is a minor mode that puts into the modeline a running
count of the words in the buffer.  Because computing the number of
words can be computationally expensive for large buffers, the count
is only updated when Emacs has been idle for `wcount-idleness'
seconds, or when the user presses C-c w (`wcount-count').")

blogger.el implements the Blogger API to talk to weblog software.

For ease of use:
I use the following commands in my .emacs file:

(load-file \"blogger.el\")
(global-set-key \"\\C-cbs\" 'blogger-start-post)

C-c b s will switch to a new buffer where you can compose a
post.

C-x C-s    -- post-and-publish current buffer to the blog.
              Calling blogger-save-post with an prefix argument
              (i.e. C-u C-c C-c) will prompt for which weblog
              to use.

C-c C-c    -- identical to C-x C-s, but will also bury the buffer.

C-c C-n    -- post (but not publish) the current message and
              load the next message.

C-c C-p    -- post (but not publish) the current message and
              load the previous message.

C-c C-k    -- delete the current post.

M-g        -- synchronise blogger.el's idea of the posts available
              with the blogger server.

** TBD ** C-c C-t m  -- edit the main template.

** TBD ** C-c C-t a  -- edit the Archive Index template


Notes:
----

This code is based on Simon Kittle's blogger.el
(http://www.tswoam.co.uk/files/blogger.el.txt), but where his
code calls a Perl program, this code uses xml-rpc.el.  You can
get xml-rpc.el from <http://elisp.info/package/xml-rpc/>

Differences between SK's blogger.el and this one:

- Doesn't need any external programs.  Uses xml-rpc.el.
- I've added a bunch of defcustom's here to make this integrate
  better with Emacs Customization interface. 
- Created a *blogger* mode.
- Made selection of a blog more intuitive.  It queries the
  Blogger server and allows the user to choose the name of the
  blog from a list.
- Prompt for blog on initial post if blogger-id isn't set.
- Can \"ping\" http://weblogs.com/ and http://blo.gs/ whenever
  you update.
- Can \"scroll\" through posts on the blogger server and edit them.

Todo:

 * RSS creation
 * Implement MetaWeblog API
 * Implement MovableType extentions

Bugs:

 * When you delete a post it gets deleted, but it doesn't
 disappear from your post ring until you sync (M-g) with the server.")

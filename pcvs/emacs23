 :commentary "\
PCL-CVS is a front-end to the CVS version control system.  For people
familiar with VC, it is somewhat like VC-dired: it presents the status of
all the files in your working area and allows you to commit/update several
of them at a time.  Compared to VC-dired, it is considerably better and
faster (but only for CVS).

PCL-CVS was originally written by Per Cederqvist many years ago.  This
version derives from the XEmacs-21 version, itself based on the 2.0b2
version (last release from Per).  It is a thorough rework.

Contrary to what you'd expect, PCL-CVS is not a replacement for VC but only
for VC-dired.  As such, I've tried to make PCL-CVS and VC interoperate
seamlessly (I also use VC).

To use PCL-CVS just use `M-x cvs-examine RET <dir> RET'.
There is a TeXinfo manual, which can be helpful to get started.")

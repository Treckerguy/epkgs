 :commentary "\
`ishl-mode' is a mode that does additional highlighting during
incremental searches.  Using the relatively unobtrusive \"secondary
selection\" face, ishl highlights *every* match for the current
search string.  (Of course, the *current* match remains highlighted
with the \"region\" face.)  It does this in a deferred fashion using
idle timers, so the cycles needed to highlight additional matches
do not rob isearch of its usual snappy response.

The additional highlighting makes it easier to anticipate where the
cursor will land each time you press C-s or C-r to repeat a pending
search forward or backward.

Each time the search string is changed, ishl-mode waits
`ishl-initial-delay' seconds, then starts highlighting matches one
every `ishl-delay' seconds.  These numbers are 1/4 and 1/16 by
default.")

This file provides a specialized minor mode for lojban text.

It includes syntactical highlighting for lojban words.
The three basic word types (cmavo, cmene, and brivla), sentence
separators and attitudinal indicators are highlighted with
different faces.

There is specialized support for `outline-mode' with valid lojban
headers, though this is quite an experimental feature.

Where ordinary outlines would look like these:
   * Header 1
   ** Subheader 1
   ** Subheader 2
   ** Subheader 3

In lojban mode you can use the cmavo ni'o in a similar (though
reversed) way you could use asterisks.
   ni'oni'o pamoi tcita
   ni'o pamoi tcita
   ni'o remoi tcita
   ni'o cimoi tcita

This file requires lojban.el, a lojban utility function library you
should have received in the same way you received this file.

Typical user .emacs configuration:
    (setq load-path
      (cons \"/path/to/lojban-mode.el/and/lojban.el\"
        load-path))
    (autoload 'lojban-mode \"lojban-mode\" nil t)
Additional configuration is available via M-x customize lojban-mode")

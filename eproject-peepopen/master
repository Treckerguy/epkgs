 :commentary "\
A sensible fuzzy file chooser with a beautiful Mac OS X GUI.
This version replaces peeopen.el's dependency on the heavy-weight
textmate mode with a lighter weight dependency on jrockway's eproject
needed only for identifying the root directory of a project

Calls the external PeepOpen.app when you hit Meta-t (or equivalent) in eproject-mode.

   M-t - Go to File

Installation:

This plugin assumes that you've already loaded Jonathan Rockway's
eproject.el in your emacs configuration. Load this file afterward.

Copy this file to ~/.emacs.d/vendor/eproject-peepopen.el


You'll also need eproject.el:

  $ cd ~/.emacs.d/vendor
  $ git clone https://github.com/jrockway/eproject.git

Require both libraries and activate eproject.
In most Emacs distributions, you'll do this in ~/.emacs.d/init.el
or your personal configuration file.

In Aquamacs, this goes in ~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el.

  (add-to-list 'load-path \"~/.emacs.d/vendor/eproject.el\")
  (require 'eproject)
  (add-to-list 'load-path \"~/.emacs.d/vendor/\")
  (require 'eproject-peepopen)

For Emacs 23 or Aquamacs, use this to open files in the existing frame:

  (setq ns-pop-up-frames nil)

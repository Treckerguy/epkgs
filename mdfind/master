A quick and dirty major mode for displaying results of OS X's
`mdfind' command. Put this file in your load path and require
`mdfind': an interactive function of the same name will be
available. When invoked, it will ask you for a directory and a
query string that will be passed to the OS X mfind command. The
results of the query are then displayed on a special, read-only
buffer, whose mode derives from `org-mode' (so that links to files
are nicely displayed and clickable). In that buffer the following
key shortcuts are available:
  - n : go to next link
  - p : go to previous link
  - RET, o : follow link
  - q : bury buffer
  - m : perform new query

Convert date strings to \"YYYYMMDD\" format.

This library is a hack and I have no intention to ever to ever complete
it.  It is currently used by my `elx.el' but I plan to replace it with
a better solution.  At least `date-calc.el' and `strptime.el' provide
similar (and much more) functionality but at least the latter does not
work with GNU Emacs.  Do not use this library; I only keep it alive
until I have settled for a replacement.")

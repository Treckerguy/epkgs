Convert date strings to \"YYYYMMDD\" format.

Note: The functions defined here commonly require a string as argument.
      But they also accept nil instead of a string in which case they
      simply return nil.  Convinient since this relieves callers from
      the need to verify the argument first which would otherwise be
      needed a lot in library `elx.el' for which this was written.
Note: Some libraries that might provide similar functionality:
      `date-calc.el', `strptime.el'.
Note: You shouldn't use this library yet - it has to be polished first.

This is a major mode for use with mutt (http://www.mutt.org/), slrn, or most
email and newsreaders that allow you to use an external editor.

Installation:

Add the following line to the .emacs(.el) file in your home directory:

  (load \"/your/local/path/to/this/file/post\")

Note that you can omit the \".el\" from the file name when calling load.

If you want to make it available to all your users, type \\C-h v
load-path RET, pick an appropriate directory for post.el, and modify
your sitewide default.el to (require 'post).

You may find the latest version of this mode at
http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~rreid/software/email/ or possibly
http://sourceforge.net/projects/post-mode/



BUGS:

Rob: I predict that some buffers (*Original*<2>, *Composing*<2>?)
will be left behind if you edit more than one message at a time.


Thanks

Dave Pearson: Code, feature ideas, Mutt experience. Many thanks!
Louis Theran: Encouragement to make Mutt mode work like Emacs MUAs.
Ronald: Enlightening gripes about what Emacs should do, but doesn't.
Robert Napier: Bug reports about font-lock mode, fancy wrapping.
Kevin Rodgers: Answered RR's question on gnu.emacs.help on
overwriting server-process-filter's annoying message at startup.


Revision History

$Log: post.el,v $
Revision 1.10  2008/02/24 23:49:23  rreid
*** empty log message ***

Revision 1.9  2008/02/24 23:46:23  rreid
I really hate the way RCS/VC mucks around with the version number and log.
It's not as dwim as it thinks it is.

Revision 1.8  2008/02/24 23:43:46  rreid
Updated email address.

Revision 2.402  2008/02/24 23:31:19  rreid
Emacs 22 finally fixed (how-many) to return an int instead of a string,
i.e. 13 instead of '13 occurrences'.  A few people noticed that the change
broke my workaround, but Erik Mugele submitted the winning patch that works
for all emacs versions (I hope).

This, and the below, are real entries, with real version numbers.  Some of
the above are fake commits to get the version number back in sync.

Revision 2.401  2004/07/23 16:27:29  rreid
Fixed post-delete-quoted-signatures to not remove sneaky things like quoted
double dash arrows.  Thanks go to Felix Klee for a clear bug report.

Revision 2.4  2002/04/22 22:04:29  reid
Tweaked post-emoticon-pattern yet again.  Made cl mandatory for all
versions of emacs.  (Thanks to Eric Dorland and Mike Schiraldi for bug
reports.)  Fixed post-unquote-region.  (Thanks to Mike Schiraldi for the
bug report.)

Revision 2.3  2002/04/21 20:13:55  reid
Improved post-emoticon-pattern.

Revision 2.2  2002/04/20 04:12:54  reid
Improved post-emoticon-pattern.

Revision 2.1  2002/04/20 03:17:48  reid
- A major (but not total) synchronization with Dave Pearson's post-mode.
  header-set-followup-to and header-set-organization should work now.
- Syntax highlighting now works for quoted email addresses and URLs.
- *bold* words are now highlighted.
- Emoticons can now be highlighted, and the default regexp,
  post-emoticon-pattern, might be too enthusiastic for your taste.  In case
  you're curious, I verified that gnus' smiley-ems.el works with post, but I
  decided that it wasn't ideal.
- post-url-text-pattern changed to post-url-pattern and made more enthusiastic.

revision 1.95 2002/04/10 00:06:26 reid
Fixed the regexp in post-kill-signature to not delete everything between
mutt's standard forwarding lines.  post-kill-signature is called indirectly
by many functions.

Revision 1.9  2002/04/04 22:24:31  reid
Applied a patch (not quite verbatim) from The Anarcat
<anarcat@anarcat.dyndns.org> to make the entity separating siglets in
`post-variable-signature-source' a regexp, `post-signature-sep-regexp'.  The
default works either either the old post file format or strfiled (fortune)
files.

Changed default `post-random-signature-command' to `fortune
~/.mutt/sigs.fortune'.

`post-random-signature-command' should now NOT supply a fixed sig portion!

(post-el-random-signature) supplied by The Anarcat to do random sig
selection purely within Emacs Lisp.

Revision 1.8  2002/02/06 22:24:31  eric
clean up

Revision 1.7.2  2002/02/06 22:17:01  eric
tweak regexps, make font-lock-comment-face be post-signature-text-face

Revision 1.7.1  2002/02/06 21:58:58  eric
tweak regexp, change some types to regexp

Revision 1.7.0  2002/02/06 21:36:56  eric
hilight signatures, urls and emails

Revision 1.6.3.10  1999/10/11 00:29:41  roland
Corrected color quoting again: Now allows \">\" in the middle of
a line which is quoted twice.

Revision 1.6.3.9  1999/10/08 10:43:18  roland
Add third level of quoting faces.
Allow super-cite name prefixes before quote signs.

Revision 1.6.3.8  1999/10/08 08:39:00  roland
post-font-lock-keywords now detects lines with only \"> \"in it
correctly (merged following line into it before).

Revision 1.6.3.7  1999/10/04 10:07:48  roland
Add post-quote-region and post-unquote-region commands to quote and
unquote a region (one level).

Revision 1.6.3.6  1999/09/03 23:13:55  reid
Valeriy E. Ushakov <uwe@ptc.spbu.ru> pointed out that (GNU) Emacs <20 has
fewer (optional) arguments to (read-string) than what I was using to
inherit the input method.  I didn't find a way off the top of my head
to redefine (read-string) without causing an infinite loop, so I have
substituted a macro (string-read prompt) which does the right thing,
so please use it instead of read-string.

Revision 1.6.3.5  1999/08/29 19:58:49  reid
Changed default post-mail-message to handle hostnames with digits.
Thanks to Brian D. Winters <brianw@alumni.caltech.edu>.

Revision 1.6.3.4  1999/03/20 03:02:05  reid
Made post compatible with emacs as far back as 19.28.1, probably
farther.

Revision 1.6.3.3  1999/03/16 03:14:07  reid
Cleaned up post-select-signature-select-sig-from-file code.

Revision 1.6.3.2  1999/03/16 03:05:12  reid
Fixed alist updating.

Revision 1.6.3.1  1999/03/13 02:23:48  reid
Added defface to the list of things that get defined if customize
hasn't already done it.  Thanks to Melissa Binde for the bug report.

Modified post-body-says-attach to use a regexp,
post-attachment-regexp, so that something like \"\\(attach\\|anbringen\\)\"
can be used by bilingual people like Roland.

Revision 1.6.2.1  1999/03/12 10:16:11  roland
Added missing () to post-insert-to-auto-mode-alist-on-load.

Revision 1.6.2 1999/03/11 15:51 Dave Pearson
header-position-on-value fixed to return (point), and
defcustom macro provided for Emacs 19 users.

Revision 1.6.1.2  1999/03/06 11:24:43  roland
Added post-insert-to-auto-mode-alist-on-load.

Revision 1.6.1.1  1999/03/06 11:02:27  roland
Customized renaming of buffer.
Removed different handling for mail, news, news-reply.
Fixed problems with easy-menu under XEmacs.

Revision 1.6.0 1999/03/04 18:04 Rob Reid
Returned post-signature-pattern to using \"--\" instead of \"-- \"
because some senders have broken MTAs (as Eric reminded me) and
some users don't use procmail to compensate.  This time all of the
functions dealing with signatures have been smartened up to avoid
false matches.  Unfortunately that means they don't use
post-signature-pattern in its raw form.

Added post-backup-original so that Dave's post-copy-original can
be used.

Kevin Rodgers explained how to put this in .emacs to fix the
server-process-filter's annoying message problem:

Revision 1.1  1999/03/04 18:02:30  reid
Initial revision

%%%%%%%%%%%% Put in .emacs %%%%%%%%%%%

;;; Email

(load \"/home/reid/.mutt/post\")
(defadvice server-process-filter (after post-mode-message first activate)

   message with a post-save-current-buffer-and-exit message.\"
   (if (eq major-mode 'post-mode)
       (message
        (substitute-command-keys \"Type \\\\[describe-mode] for help composing; \\\\[post-save-current-buffer-and-exit] when done.\"))))
; This is also needed to see the magic message.  Set to a higher

(add-hook 'server-switch-hook
        (function (lambda()
                    (cond ((string-match \"Post\" mode-name)
                           (post-goto-body))))))

%%%%%%%%% We now return to our regular commentary %%%%%%%%%

Eric Kidd asked that the name of Headers mode be changed so that
it doesn't conflict with mutt-mode's Headers, so I changed it to
just Header (no s).

Revision 1.5? 1999/02/27 17:30 Rob Reid
I had a go at combining Dave Pearson's post mode with Eric Kidd's
Mutt mode.  Since Dave Pearson's post mode explicitly handles news as
well as email, and this should be useful for more than just mutt,
I'm calling it post mode.  I also added functions for picking
random signatures, selecting a signature from a file, and
intelligently (IMHO) prompting the user for an attachment when
necessary.  Changed mutt-save-buffer-and-exit to work better with
emacsclient, and some of the key bindings.  post-signature-pattern
now defaults to use \"-- \" instead of \"--\", and I have far less
trouble this way (I use procmail to clean up braindead \"--\"s.).  I
don't know why Eric warned against trailing whitespace.

Revision 1.4  1998/04/11 00:05:46  emk
Fixed font-lock bug. Also made mutt-mode a little more careful about
saving various bits of Emacs state when moving around the buffer.

Revision 1.3  1998/03/25 00:37:36  emk
Added support for menus and font-lock mode, plus a few bug fixes.

Revision 1.2  1998/03/24 13:19:46  emk
Major overhaul--more commands, a minor mode for header editing, and other
desirable features. Attaching files seems to be broken, though.

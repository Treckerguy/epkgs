In Dired, when you choose a directory to visit,
 it is normally visited in a new buffer – the
 Dired buffer you chose it in is not deleted.
 Some people don’t like this behavior, because as you
 navigate around the directory tree you accumulate
 Dired buffers, one for each directory you visit.

 So ,`joseph-single-dired.el' can make you just open
 a single dired buffer.
 I bind `dired-mouse-find-alternate-file' on [mouse-2]
 so even you click on a directory in dired buffer ,
 it will reuse current dired buffer too.


Installation:

 Just put `joseph-single-dired.el' to your load-path.
 The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
 It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
 (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name \"~/elisp\"))

 Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.

 (eval-after-load 'dired '(progn (require 'joseph-single-dired)))

 No need more.")

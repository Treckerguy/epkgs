Overview
========
This library provides a keyboard operation method corresponding
to double click on a mouse.


INSTALLING
==========
To install this library, save this file to a directory in your
`load-path' (you can view the current `load-path' using \"C-h v
load-path RET\" within Emacs), then add the following line to your
.emacs startup file:

   (require 'double-type)


USING
=====
You can bind commands to keyboard events \"single type\" and
\"double type\" on a key via a function `double-type/define-key'
which is provided by this library.

  Examples)

    ;; Save buffer with key <double-C-s>.
    (double-type/define-key global-map \"\\C-s\"
                            :on-single-type 'isearch-forward
                            :on-double-type 'save-buffer)
    
    ;; Other window with key <double-C-o>.
    (double-type/define-key global-map \"\\C-o\"
                            :on-single-type 'open-line
                            :on-double-type 'other-window)
    
    ;; Open RE-Builder with key <double-C-r>.
    (double-type/define-key global-map \"\\C-r\"
                            :on-single-type 'isearch-backward
                            :on-double-type 're-builder)
    
    ;; Insert current time with key <double-M-t>.
    (double-type/define-key esc-map \"t\"
                            :on-single-type 'transpose-words
                            :on-double-type (lambda ()
                                              (interactive)
                                              (insert (current-time-string))))
    
    ;; Insert mail address by keyboard macro with key <double-@>.
    (double-type/define-key global-map \"@\"
                            :on-single-type 'self-insert-command
                            :on-double-type \"my-name@example.com\")
    
    ;; Use <double-C-w> as prefix key `ctl-x-4-map'.
    (double-type/define-key global-map \"\\C-w\"
                            :on-single-type 'kill-region
                            :on-double-type ctl-x-4-map)

  NOTE: You had better not to assign \"double type\" event to the
        keys which will be typed repeatedly, like \"C-f\", \"C-b\"
        and so on. (Such assignment may be annoying to you...)


KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============
- Codes aside, this document should be rewritten.
  My English sucks.
- While defining keyboard macro, \"double type\" event will be
  disabled because of technical reason.


WISH LIST
=========
- Show \"single-type\" and \"double-type\" bindings by `where-is'.
- Show commands bound to \"double-type\" event by `describe-key'.
- Deal with keyboard macro.")

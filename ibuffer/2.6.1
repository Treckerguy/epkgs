 :commentary "\
ibuffer.el is an advanced replacement for the `buffer-menu' which
is normally distributed with Emacs.  Its interface is intended to
be analogous to that of Dired.

Place this file somewhere in your `load-path', and add:

(require 'ibuffer)

to your ~/.emacs file.  After that, you should be able to type 'M-x
ibuffer' to get started.  'h' will give a brief usage description.

Note that if you want to get the best performance out of ibuffer
(especially if you usually have more than 50 buffers open), you
should byte-compile it.  Type 'M-x emacs-lisp-byte-compile' when
you have this file open, and a compiled version will be written in
the same directory.

A few tips on usage:

* If you use global-font-lock-mode, and want fontification in
  ibuffer, be sure to say

(global-font-lock-mode 1)

 before you do (require 'ibuffer) in your ~/.emacs file.  For more
 precise control over highlighting, customize the variable
 `ibuffer-fontification-level'.

Just for fun, here is the author's favorite `ibuffer-formats'
configuration:

(setq ibuffer-formats '((mark modified read-only \" \" (name 16 16) \" \"
                        (size 6 -1 :right) \" \" (mode 16 16 :center)
                         \" \" (process 8 -1) \" \" filename)
                    	   (mark \" \" (name 16 -1) \" \" filename))
      ibuffer-elide-long-columns t
      ibuffer-eliding-string \"&\")

Remember, you can switch between formats using
`ibuffer-switch-format', bound to ` by default.")

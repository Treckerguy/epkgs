 :commentary "\
Inspired by Bob Glickstein's sregex, this package lets you compose
regular expressions for regex searching in a special buffer, in the
more readable sregex format.

EG, \"^a*$\" is written as ``bol (star \"a\" ) eol''

Special disclaimer: I wrote it on a whim after seeing sregex.  I
haven't added bells and whistles or actual help documentation.
This should be considered alpha software.

This requires tehom-1.el, tehom-2.el, sregex, and isearch.

I've copied (defmacro regex ...) from sregex in order to fix it.
This file will automatically load sregex first, but if you change
that to make sregex load later, it will not work.")

 :commentary "\
This file contains all the necessary functions and macros, taken from
cc-mode, to implement hungry deletion without relying on cc-mode.  This
allows it to be used more easily in all modes, as it is now a minor mode in
it's own right.

Installation

To use this mode, just put the following in your .emacs file:
(require 'hungry-delete)
and add turn-on-hungry-delete-mode to all relevant hooks.")

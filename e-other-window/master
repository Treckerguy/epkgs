The e-other-window package places an overlay across the current buffer after
you use `other-window'.  This keeps the user from being confused as to where
the current (point) is.

The overlay is removed after `e-other-window-interval' seconds.  This is what
provides the flash effect.

The major advantage is that instead of trying to find one small cursor in
your large emacs frame you can now just look for the 'flash'.")

 :commentary "\
Viper is a full-featured Vi emulator for Emacs and XEmacs.  It emulates and
improves upon the standard features of Vi and, at the same time, allows
full access to all Emacs facilities.  Viper supports multiple undo,
file name completion, command, file, and search history and it extends
Vi in many other ways.  Viper is highly customizable through the various
hooks, user variables, and keymaps.  It is implemented as a collection
of minor modes and it is designed to provide full access to all Emacs
major and minor modes.")

-----------
 This is an emacs major mode to provide some help to programmers who
 must edit Pick-style Proc language programs. It provides keyword
 colourisation and not much else.

 Tested for XEmacs 19.15 and GNU Emacs 20.3


INSTALLATION
 ------------
 Put 

   (autoload 'proc-mode \"proc-mode\" \"Mode for Pick PROC procedures.\" t)

 into your .emacs file and type M-x proc-mode in any buffer you think
 is suitable.

 You can also add

   (autoload 'proc-insert-emacs-tag \"proc-mode\" nil t)

 if you want to be able to easilly tag a buffer as proc mode for emacs.
 I recommend binding these functions to keys, possibly

  C-c p   to proc-mode
  C-c C-p to proc-insert-emacs-tag

 This can be done with something like:

   (defun Ctl-C-prefix () Ctl-C-keymap)
   (defvar Ctl-C-keymap (make-keymap) \"Keymap for C-c prefix.\")
   (global-set-key \"\\C-c\" (Ctl-C-prefix))
   (define-key Ctl-C-keymap \"p\"    'proc-mode)
   (define-key Ctl-C-keymap \"\\C-p\" 'proc-insert-emacs-tag)

 Only that PROCs are so hideous.")

Add a special Org link type, that, when clicked, opens an
SVG image of a certain track.

Example link:
  [[track:((12.0399212 14.919293)(32.12394 15.342345))FILE.svg][Track]]

An link's path consists of a list of coordinates and the
filename.  As usual, the description part (\\\"Track\\\" in
this case) is optional.
See the documentation for `osm-track-regexp' for a
description of the coordinates.

Installation
------------

Make sure `osm-maps.el' and `org-osm-link.el' are in your
`load-path' and add this to your emacs setup:
    (require 'org-osm-link)")

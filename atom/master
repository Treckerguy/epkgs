 :commentary "\
This is a library for creating an Atom feed from a Lisp program.
The normal usage is to create a feed with `atom-create', giving it
a title and a Web address. Once the feed has been created, entries
may be added to the feed, by specifying (at the minimum) a title, a
permanent link and the content of the entry. Text-only, HTML and
XHTML entries are supported.

It is possible to produce both Atom and RSS feeds.

A typical usage would look like this:

(let ((my-atom-feed (atom-create \"My feed\" \"http://example.org\")))
  ; A simple, text-only entry
  (atom-add-text-entry
   my-atom-feed
   \"Hello world\"
   \"http://example.org/hello\"
   \"Hello the world!\")

  (atom-add-xhtml-entry
   my-atom-feed
   \"An XHTML example\"
   \"http://example.org/html-example\"
   \"<p>One can also use <acronym>XHTML</acronym> in the entries.</p>\")

  (atom-print my-atom-feed)
  ;; If you prefer RSS feeds:
  (atom-to-rss-print my-atom-feed))

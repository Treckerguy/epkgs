If you are planning on adding a language to org-babel we would ask
that if possible you fill out the FSF copyright assignment form
available at http://orgmode.org/request-assign-future.txt as this
will make it possible to include your language support in the core
of Org-mode, otherwise unassigned language support files can still
be included in the contrib/ directory of the Org-mode repository.

Requirements:

You need to have a copy of LilyPond")

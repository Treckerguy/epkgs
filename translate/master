This little utility automizes the access to a _WORDLIST_ which contains
for example an english word and its german translation. The approach
is very very simple: grep-ing over the specified dictionary and present
the results. The specified default dictionary could be found on
ftp.uni-ulm.de/pub/misc/dict/english_german.tar.gz.
As of 2003, the wordlist is often already part of your friendly
Linux distribution. For instance, it is shipped with Debian
in the package trans-de-en.

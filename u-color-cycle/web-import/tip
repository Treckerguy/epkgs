u-color-cycle provides a set of commands which temporarily change the
 colors in the current buffer.  Colors will change until the next
 interaction (key press, mouse event) occurs.  The original color-status
 of the current buffer is restored afterwards.  The contents of the
 buffer are unchanged! Load this file and say `M-x u-color-cycle-window
 RET' to find out what this means.

 The following color-cycling methods are available:

 * `u-color-cycle-window':
     The whole text gets the same foreground color which is for changed
     smoothly.
 * `u-color-cycle-window-rainbow':
     The text color changes smoothly from one character to the next.
     The colors move through the text.  This method was contributed by
     Jesse Weinstein.
 * `u-color-cycle-window-fade':
     The foreground colors slowly fade away so that the buffer contents
     become \"invisible\".
 * `u-color-cycle-window-swap':
     The faces (not only colors) in the buffer are interchanged between
     text portions with different faces.

 Each command exists in a u-color-cycle-region-* variant as well.

 You may want to add the u-color-cycle functions to the list of
 `zone-programs'. This is one way to do it:

 (eval-after-load 'zone 
   '(progn 
      (load-library \"u-color-cycle\") 
      (setq zone-programs (vconcat zone-programs [u-color-cycle-window
                                   u-color-cycle-window-fade
                                   u-color-cycle-window-swap
                                   u-color-cycle-window-rainbow]))))

 u-color-cycle uses overlays.  It might therefore happen that
 interferences with other packages like highlight-current-line or hifill
 occur.


 The overlay stuff was inspired by flyspell.el

Description:
Automatically cache byte-compiled versions of .el files as they're
loaded, automatically recompiling them as necessary.

Install:
Load this file as early as possible in ~/.emacs (after setting
variables, and after custom, if you used custom to set them.)
Anything loaded after it will be automatically byte-compiled.

This file cannot byte-compile itself, so you should do that
separately.

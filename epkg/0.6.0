The stupid package tracker for Emacs.

       ,- going to be
       |
Epkg is a package manager for Emacs packages.  It makes heavy use of
Git - the stupid content tracker.  Packages are installed by cloning
the package's git repository from the Emacsmirror.

This branch contains a version of epkg which lacks any package
management features.  The branch where work on these parts are done is
currently not available.

This branch however can be used to list all packages available from the
Emacsmirror (https://github.com/emacsmirror).  In it's current form it
is similar to `ell.el' which lists package recorded in the Emacs Lisp
List (http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/sje30/emacs/ell.html).

The following packages which are not distributed with Emacs are
required by this version of epkg: `listing', `magit' and `vcomp'.

The easiest way to install epkg is to clone the bootstrap repository
at https://github.com/emacsmirror/.emacs.d and follow the instructions
in the README.md file inside this repository.  However lacking the
package managment features which justify this the steps required to
install this package are a bit to involved.")

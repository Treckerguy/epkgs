 :commentary "\
This library provides function `listing-create' which inserts the
elements in a list into a buffer, one per row.  Columns are used to
display different attributes of the elements.

How a cell's values is calculated and formatted is not restricted by
this package in any way.

In other words this library can be used by other libraries to easily
create tables similar to the one created by `buffer-menu' but for
arbitrary objects and without much effort.

A very basic example:

  (listing-create '((A . a) (B . b) (C . c))
                  (get-buffer-create \"*listing*\")
                  '((\"upper\" 5 t car)
                    (\"lower\" 5 t cdr)))

But it doesn't stop here.  See the function `listing-create' and
variable `listing-view-element-function' for more information.  This
library was created for library `epkg.el', which serves well as an
example.")

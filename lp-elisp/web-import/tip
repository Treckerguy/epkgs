 :commentary "\
At one time, my .emacs file was a literate program made with this
poor-man's literate programming system for Emacs Lisp. It uses
\\davidw's  `two-mode-mode.el' to allow us to edit the files
using both \\LaTeX\\ and  `emacs-lisp' major modes.

I've since switched to using \\texttt `noweb', and I recommend that you do
the same.

If you have the elisp but don't have the LaTeX source, you can find it
here:

        \\selfhref `http://edward.oconnor.cx/elisp/lp-elisp.tex'")

 :commentary "\
This package provides support for insertion of electric characters
 with the tempo package into cc-mode buffers.  The current problem
 with tempo is that it requires hard coding in the templates where
 braces, and such forth should go, whilst cc-mode is perfectly
 capable of making these decisions automatically.  This package
 allows tempo to insert these characters and have cc-mode behave
 appropriately.

 In practice what this means is that instead of putting \"{\" into
 your tempo template, you put (i ?{) (this should NOT be quoted, as
 tempo needs to evaluate it!). If you have switched on the auto
 electric mode within cc-mode it will now newline and reindent this
 \"{\" depending on your indentation settings.


this is an example of a complete template where all electric charcters
of cc-mode (here: (){};) will be inserted with the new i-element of this
package.

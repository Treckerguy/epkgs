 :commentary "\
cua-lite is a CUA emulator package for Emacs.  There are three
 things that make this package different from the others already
 out there:

 1) it is a quasi-minor mode, meaning that it can be turned on &
    off easily (though only globally; hence the \"quasi-\")
 2) it is easily extensible
 3) it does NOT attempt to override the existing use of <Ctrl><X>
    and <Ctrl><C> (use CUA-mode for that)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Note for XEmacs users:

 XEmacs uses a very different paradigm for defining what the region
 is, whether or not it is highlighted by default, and whether or
 not it remains highlighted when point is moved.  This is analagous
 to GNU Emacs' transient-mode, and at first glance it seems to make
 it much easier to implement functions which affect it.  However,
 it is vastly different then GNU Emacs, and would essentially
 require a total re-write of cua-lite to support it, or a great
 deal of hoop jumping, neither of which I have the time for.  So,
 (for the moment) cua-lite will not support XEmacs -- sorry!  If
 it's any consolation, XEmacs does half of what cua-lite does
 already, and makes a great deal of the rest of it easier to
 implement.

Installation:

 There are two ways to install this package.  The first is to
 install it and load it immediately.  This is the appropriate
 method if you know you want to load it all of the time.

 The second method is to use a bootstrap package,
 `cua-lite-bootstrap'.  This package will set up an autoload
 statement for cua-lite, and (optionally) define a hotkey to toggle
 the package on and off.  This is to encourage people to have the
 package available for use by others even if they themselves do not
 wish to use it, while at the same time utilizing almost no
 resources.  See the bootstrap file for more details.

 To load and enable each time (method #1), put this file on your
 Emacs-Lisp load path and add the following to your ~/.emacs
 startup file:

    (require 'cua-lite)
    (cua-lite 1)

 To add a directory to your load-path, use something like the following:

     (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name \"/some/load/path\"))")

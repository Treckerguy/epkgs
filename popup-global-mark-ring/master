 :commentary "\
This software is greatly inspired by popup-kill-ring
and created thanks to popup.el,
so I'd like to express my gratitude to its authors.

Apparently, there still are many bugs, so please be generous.

Requirement:

* popup.el   http://github.com/m2ym/auto-complete

Installation:

Copy popup-global-mark-ring.el to your load-path and add to your .emacs:

(require 'popup-global-mark-ring)

To use popup-global-mark-ring, do M-x popup-global-mark-ring.
Or assign the key whatever you want to to 'popup-global-mark-ring.
For example,
(global-set-key \"\\C-c\\C-g\" 'popup-global-mark-ring)

Usage notes
When a menu is being showd, you can switch between global-mark-ring
menu and local-mark-ring menu by \"\\C-t\".")

Introduction:

Whitespaces (spaces and tabs) are not visible by default. This package,
when it is activated, highlights spaces and tabs. It may be useful to see
trailing whitespaces (and to decide to use 'delete-trailing-whitespace').
Highlight rules can be easily change to fit your need (specific highlights
for leading and trailing spaces for instance).

You can choose between two modes of highlighting:
 - color: show whitespaces with faces
 - mark: show whitespaces with specific characters
Use 'cutomize-group RET show-whitespace' to see the description.

Usage:

Go to the appropriate buffer and press:
  M-x show-whitespace-mode RET

The function `turn-on-show-whitespace-mode' could be added to any major
mode hook to activate Show-Whitespace Mode for all buffers in that
mode.  For example, the following line will activate Show-Whitespace
Mode in all SGML mode buffers:

(add-hook 'sgml-mode-hook 'turn-on-show-whitespace-mode)

Support:

 Any comments, suggestions, bug reports or upgrade requests are welcome.

Compatibility:

 This version of show-whitespace has been developed with NTEmacs 21.2.1
 under MS Windows XP (nt5.1). It has been tested on linux both in X
 and console.
 Please, let me know if it works with other OS and versions of Emacs.

Thanks:

I would like to thank Pieter Pareit for the suggestion of the mark style;
and for his precious tips.")

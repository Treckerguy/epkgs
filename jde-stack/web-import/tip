 :commentary "\
This package provides the ability to jump from stack traces to the
relevant part of the java source. There is one main entry point
which is a mouse-1 click on the stack trace, which will jump to the
source suggested at this point. This should also work in other
buffers (for instance log files), by calling directly the function
`jde-stack-show-at-point'. Following this entry point two functions
`jde-stack-show-next' and `jde-stack-show-prev' allow cycling
backwards and forwards through the stack trace. Error messages are
given when the end of the stack is reached.")

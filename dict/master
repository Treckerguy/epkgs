Make sure that your dict client is properly installed. It can be
obtained from http://www.dict.org
Then you may setq several variables. These are default values:

(setq dict-pathname \"dict\")
This should be pathname of your dict executable

(setq dict-server-host nil)
Hostname or ip address of dictd server, if 'nil' dict client will be
called without -h option which means that it will try to connect to
dict.org servers

(setq dict-server-port nil)
Tcp port where dictd listens

(setq dict-db-name nil)
Database name. Default (nil) is to lookup in all databases. List of
available databases could be received using M-x dict-list-databases

(setq dict-strategy nil)
Lookup strategy to use. List of available strategies could be received
using M-x dict-list-strategies

Now you can lookup words using M-x dict-lookup-words. Default is to
lookup the word under cursor. You can also bind this function to some
key sequence, for example, C-c d

(global-set-key [(control ?c) d] 'dict-lookup-words)

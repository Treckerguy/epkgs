Add:

  (require 'random-idle-quote)
  (random-idle-quote)

to your ~/.emacs ... when your emacs goes into idle mode, a quote
will appear in your echo window. I use it to help me remember new
things. The quotes that have come with it are straight from
http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/EmacsNiftyTricks

But feel free to customize the random-idle-quotes to something more
useful to yourself.")

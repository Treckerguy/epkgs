 :commentary "\
This file provides a simple interface to play music in Amarok.  It
just provides some basic commands to pause/play and manipulate
playlist.  Its primary use is for control from Dired, while browsing
your music collection there.

For convenience, a command, `amarok-setup-dired-key-bindings', is
provided for setting up useful keybindings in Dired. Use that or
create your own bindings.")

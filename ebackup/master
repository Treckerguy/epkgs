Some lisp magic to add enhanced backup functions basically it mirrors the
filesystem that I am editing and copies all new backups into backup directory
that you specify.  Default is ~/.emacs-backup

The ebackup provides an \"enhanced\" backup mechanism for Emacs.  Instead of
the conventional backup alternatives in the standard Emacs, ebackup provides
the following.

- keeps all backups in ~/.emacs-backups

- stores files with directory structure.  So for example if you edited the file
  /home/burton/test.txt the backup file would be saved as
  ~/.emacs-backups/home/burton/test.txt.1

- support rotation of files.  Each time a file is backed up we store it as a
  number and then rotate these backups.  Example:

    /home/burton/test.txt.1
    /home/burton/test.txt.2
    /home/burton/test.txt.3

Should work out of the box.  All you really need to do is add this to your
lisp load path and do a (require 'ebackup).  You should also read the backups
section of the GNU Emacs manual to determine how to turn this on.

Note: Emacs21 also includes numbered backup files but it isn't as advanced as
ebackup (it doesnt include directory structure).")

for claire, an object oriented language [http://www.claire-language.com]

I warn you this is a really big hack, it won't run too fast, 
but hopefully it won't break. 

to use this file add the following to your 
~/.emacs file

    (load-library \"~/.emacs.d/claire-mode\")

next time you edit a file with the .cl extension 
it will start in claire-mode mode (hopefully)")

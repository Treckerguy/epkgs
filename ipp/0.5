The Internet Printing Protocol is intended to replace the LPD
protocol for interacting with network printers. It specifies
mechanisms for querying the capabilities of a printer, submitting
and cancelling jobs, and queue monitoring.

You can find out whether a device is IPP-capable by trying to
telnet to port 631. If it accepts the connection it probably
understands IPP. You then need to discover the path component of
the URI, for example by reading the documentation or from a driver
program. Tested or reported to work on the following devices:

  * Tektronix Phaser 750, with an URI of the form ipp://host:631/
    (empty path component)

  * HP Laserjet 4000, with a path component of /ipp/port1.

  * Xerox Document Centre 460 ST, with empty path component.

  * CUPS printer spooler (see <URL:http://www.cups.org/>).


Usage: load this package by putting in your ~/.emacs.el

   (require 'ipp)

then try printing a file using 'M-x ipp-print'. This will prompt
you for a file name (which should be in a format understood by the
printer, such as Postscript), and the URI of the printer. There are
also two functions for querying the capability of the device
`ipp-get-attributes' and examining its queue `ipp-get-jobs'. Until
I write display code for these functions you will have to call them
from the *scratch* buffer with C-j to examine their return value.


The IPP network protocol is based on HTTP/1.1 POST requests, using
a special \"application/ipp\" MIME Content-Type. The data is encoded
using simple marshalling rules.

The Internet Printing Protocol is described in a number of RFCs:
  <URL:http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2565.html>
  <URL:http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2566.html>
  <URL:http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2568.html>

and the Printer Working Group maintain a page at

  <URL:http://www.pwg.org/ipp/>


Eventually it would be nice to modify the Emacs printing API to
support this type of direct printing, so that a user could set
`ps-printer-name' to \"ipp://modern-printer:631/\" or
\"lpd://ancient-printer/queue\" (it would be easy to write a package
similar to this one implementing the LPD protocol at the network
level; the LDP protocol is very simple).

 :commentary "\
This is a fairly simple mode for Haskell, mainly for use with my
haskell-latex mode.  It has some simple Imenu support, but can also
use haskell-decl-scan.el and haskell-doc.el from haskell.org.  The
sophisticated indentation support from haskell-indent.el needs
reworking to fit in with narrowing to the chunk done by
haskell-latex.el.

There is some support for the Bird-style `inverse comment'
convention for simple literate programming.  Everything outside the
`>'-delimited regions is treated as comments.  This relies on
font-lock being turned on to add syntax properties.")

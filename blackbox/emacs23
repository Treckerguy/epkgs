The object of the game is to find four hidden balls by shooting rays
into the black box.  There are four possibilities: 1) the ray will
pass thru the box undisturbed, 2) it will hit a ball and be absorbed,
3) it will be deflected and exit the box, or 4) be deflected immediately,
not even being allowed entry into the box.

The strange part is the method of deflection.  It seems that rays will
not pass next to a ball, and change direction at right angles to avoid it.

Rays which enter and exit are numbered.  You can see that rays 1 & 5 pass
thru the box undisturbed.  Ray 2 is deflected by the northwesternmost
ball.  Likewise rays 3 and 4. Rays which hit balls and are absorbed are
marked with H.  The bottom of the left and the right of the bottom hit
the southeastern ball directly.  Rays may also hit balls after being
reflected.  Consider the H on the bottom next to the 4.  It bounces off
the NW-ern most ball and hits the central ball.  A ray shot from above
the right side 5 would hit the SE-ern most ball.  The R beneath the 5
is because the ball is returned instantly.  It is not allowed into
the box if it would reflect immediately.  The R on the top is a more
leisurely return.  Both central balls would tend to deflect it east
or west, but it cannot go either way, so it just retreats.

At the end of the game, if you've placed guesses for as many balls as
there are in the box, the true board position will be revealed.  Each
`x' is an incorrect guess of yours; `o' is the true location of a ball.")
